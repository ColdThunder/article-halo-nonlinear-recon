	Abstract = {To take full advantage of the unprecedented power of upcoming weak lensing surveys, understanding the noise, such as cosmic variance and geometry/mask effects, is as important as understanding the signal itself. Accurately quantifying the noise requires a large number of statistically independent mocks for a variety of cosmologies. This is impractical for weak lensing simulations, which are costly for simultaneous requirements of large box size (to cover a significant fraction of the past light cone) and high resolution (to robustly probe the small scale where most lensing signal resides). Therefore, fast mock generation methods are desired and are under intensive investigation. We propose a new fast weak lensing map generation method, named the inverse-Gaussianization method, based on the finding that a lensing convergence field can be Gaussianized to excellent accuracy by a local transformation [43 Y. Yu, P. Zhang, W. Lin, W. Cui, and J. N. Fry, Phys. Rev. D 84, 023523 (2011).]. Given a simulation, it enables us to produce as many as infinite statistically independent lensing maps as fast as producing the simulation initial conditions. The proposed method is tested against simulations for each tomography bin centered at lens redshift z ˜0.5 , 1, and 2, with various statistics. We find that the lensing maps generated by our method have reasonably accurate power spectra, bispectra, and power spectrum covariance matrix. Therefore, it will be useful for weak lensing surveys to generate realistic mocks. As an example of application, we measure the probability distribution function of the lensing power spectrum, from 16384 lensing maps produced by the inverse-Gaussianization method.},

	Abstract = {Volume-weighted statistics of large-scale peculiar velocity is preferred by peculiar velocity cosmology, since it is free of the uncertainties of galaxy density bias entangled in observed number density-weighted statistics. However, measuring the volume-weighted velocity statistics from galaxy (halo/simulation particle) velocity data is challenging. Therefore, the exploration of velocity assignment methods with well-controlled sampling artifacts is of great importance. For the first time, we apply the Kriging interpolation to obtain the volume-weighted velocity field. Kriging is a minimum variance estimator. It predicts the most likely velocity for each place based on the velocity at other places. We test the performance of Kriging quantified by the E-mode velocity power spectrum from simulations. Dependences on the variogram prior used in Kriging, the number nk of the nearby particles to interpolate, and the density nP of the observed sample are investigated. First, we find that Kriging induces 1% and 3% systematics at k ˜0.1 h Mpc-1 when nP˜6 ×1 0-2(h-1 Mpc )-3 and nP˜6 ×1 0-3(h-1 Mpc )-3 , respectively. The deviation increases for decreasing nP and increasing k . When nP≲6 ×1 0-4(h-1 Mpc )-3 , a smoothing effect dominates small scales, causing significant underestimation of the velocity power spectrum. Second, increasing nk helps to recover small-scale power. However, for nP≲6 ×1 0-4(h-1 Mpc )-3 cases, the recovery is limited. Finally, Kriging is more sensitive to the variogram prior for a lower sample density. The most straightforward application of Kriging on the cosmic velocity field does not show obvious advantages over the nearest-particle method [Y. Zheng, P. Zhang, Y. Jing, W. Lin, and J. Pan, Phys. Rev. D 88, 103510 (2013)] and could not be directly applied to cosmology so far. However, whether potential improvements may be achieved by more delicate versions of Kriging is worth further investigation.},

	Abstract = {A pathfinder version of CHIME (the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment) is currently being commissioned at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) in Penticton, BC. The instrument is a hybrid cylindrical interferometer designed to measure the large scale neutral hydrogen power spectrum across the redshift range 0.8 to 2.5. The power spectrum will be used to measure the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale across this poorly probed redshift range where dark energy becomes a significant contributor to the evolution of the Universe. The instrument revives the cylinder design in radio astronomy with a wide field survey as a primary goal. Modern low-noise amplifiers and digital processing remove the necessity for the analog beam forming that characterized previous designs. The Pathfinder consists of two cylinders 37m long by 20m wide oriented north-south for a total collecting area of 1,500 square meters. The cylinders are stationary with no moving parts, and form a transit instrument with an instantaneous field of view of ~100 degrees by 1-2 degrees. Each CHIME Pathfinder cylinder has a feedline with 64 dual polarization feeds placed every ~30 cm which Nyquist sample the north-south sky over much of the frequency band. The signals from each dual-polarization feed are independently amplified, filtered to 400-800 MHz, and directly sampled at 800 MSps using 8 bits. The correlator is an FX design, where the Fourier transform channelization is performed in FPGAs, which are interfaced to a set of GPUs that compute the correlation matrix. The CHIME Pathfinder is a 1/10th scale prototype version of CHIME and is designed to detect the BAO feature and constrain the distance-redshift relation. The lessons learned from its implementation will be used to inform and improve the final CHIME design.},

	Abstract = {The Tianlai experiment is dedicated to the observation of large-scale structures (LSS) by the 21 cm intensity mapping technique. In this paper, we make forecasts concerning its ability to observe or constrain the dark energy parameters and the primordial non-Gaussianity. From the LSS data, one can use the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and growth rate derived from the redshift space distortion (RSD) to measure the dark energy density and equation of state. The primordial non-Gaussianity can be constrained either by looking for scale-dependent bias in the power spectrum, or by using the bispectrum. Here, we consider three cases: the Tianlai cylinder array pathfinder that is currently being built, an upgrade of the Pathfinder Array with more receiver units, and the full-scale Tianlai cylinder array. Using the full-scale Tianlai experiment, we expect sigma w_0 ˜ 0.082 and sigma w_a ˜ 0.21 from the BAO and RSD measurements, sigma _fNL^local ˜ 14 from the power spectrum measurements with scale-dependent bias, and sigma _fNL^local ˜ 22 and sigma _fNL^equil ˜ 157 from the bispectrum measurements.},

	Abstract = {We study the nonlinear $E$-mode clustering in Lagrangian space by using large scale structure (LSS) $N$-body simulations and use the displacement field information in Lagrangian space to recover the primordial linear density field. We find that, compared to Eulerian nonlinear density fields, the $E$-mode displacement fields in Lagrangian space improves the cross-correlation scale $k$ with initial density field by factor of 6 $\sim$ 7, containing 2 orders of magnitude more primordial information. This illustrates ability of potential density reconstruction algorithms, to improve the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from current and future large scale structure surveys.},

@article{PFScosmology,
	Abstract = {The Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) is a massively multiplexed fiber-fed optical and near-infrared three-arm spectrograph (Nfiber = 2400, 380 <= lambda <= 1260 nm, 1 .^{circ}3 diameter field of view). Here, we summarize the science cases in terms of provisional plans for a 300-night Subaru survey. We describe plans to constrain the nature of dark energy via a survey of emission line galaxies spanning a comoving volume of 9.3 h-3 Gpc3 in the redshift range 0.8 < z < 2.4. In each of six redshift bins, the cosmological distances will be measured to 3% precision via the baryonic acoustic oscillation scale, and redshift-space distortion measures will constrain structure growth to 6% precision. In the near-field cosmology program, radial velocities and chemical abundances of stars in the Milky Way and M 31 will be used to infer the past assembly histories of spiral galaxies and the structure of their dark matter halos. Data will be secured for 106 stars in the Galactic thick-disk, halo, and tidal streams as faint as V ˜ 22, including stars with V < 20 to complement the goals of the Gaia mission. A medium-resolution mode with R = 5000 to be implemented in the red arm will allow the measurement of multiple alpha-element abundances and more precise velocities for Galactic stars. For the galaxy evolution program, our simulations suggest the wide wavelength range of PFS will be powerful in probing the galaxy population and its clustering over a wide redshift range. We plan to conduct a color-selected survey of 1 < z < 2 galaxies and AGN over 16 deg2 to J ~= 23.4, yielding a fair sample of galaxies with stellar masses above ˜1010 M&sun; at z ~= 2. A two-tiered survey of higher redshift Lyman break galaxies and Lyman alpha emitters will quantify the properties of early systems close to the reionization epoch.},

@article{BOSS,
	Abstract = {The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) is designed to measure the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter over a larger volume than the combined efforts of all previous spectroscopic surveys of large-scale structure. BOSS uses 1.5 million luminous galaxies as faint as i = 19.9 over 10,000 deg2 to measure BAO to redshifts z < 0.7. Observations of neutral hydrogen in the Lyalpha forest in more than 150,000 quasar spectra (g < 22) will constrain BAO over the redshift range 2.15 < z < 3.5. Early results from BOSS include the first detection of the large-scale three-dimensional clustering of the Lyalpha forest and a strong detection from the Data Release 9 data set of the BAO in the clustering of massive galaxies at an effective redshift z = 0.57. We project that BOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance dA to an accuracy of 1.0% at redshifts z = 0.3 and z = 0.57 and measurements of H(z) to 1.8% and 1.7% at the same redshifts. Forecasts for Lyalpha forest constraints predict a measurement of an overall dilation factor that scales the highly degenerate DA (z) and H -1(z) parameters to an accuracy of 1.9% at z ~ 2.5 when the survey is complete. Here, we provide an overview of the selection of spectroscopic targets, planning of observations, and analysis of data and data quality of BOSS.},

	Abstract = {DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) is a Stage IV ground-based dark energy experiment that will study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the growth of structure through redshift-space distortions with a wide-area galaxy and quasar redshift survey. To trace the underlying dark matter distribution, spectroscopic targets will be selected in four classes from imaging data. We will measure luminous red galaxies up to $z=1.0$. To probe the Universe out to even higher redshift, DESI will target bright [O II] emission line galaxies up to $z=1.7$. Quasars will be targeted both as direct tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution and, at higher redshifts ($ 2.1 < z < 3.5$), for the Ly-$\alpha$ forest absorption features in their spectra, which will be used to trace the distribution of neutral hydrogen. When moonlight prevents efficient observations of the faint targets of the baseline survey, DESI will conduct a magnitude-limited Bright Galaxy Survey comprising approximately 10 million galaxies with a median $z\approx 0.2$. In total, more than 30 million galaxy and quasar redshifts will be obtained to measure the BAO feature and determine the matter power spectrum, including redshift space distortions.},

	Abstract = {We study the nonlinear evolution of baryon acoustic oscillations in the dark matter power spectrum and the correlation function using renormalized perturbation theory. In a previous paper we showed that renormalized perturbation theory successfully predicts the damping of acoustic oscillations; here we extend our calculation to the enhancement of power due to mode coupling. We show that mode coupling generates additional oscillations that are out of phase with those in the linear spectrum, leading to shifts in the scales of oscillation nodes defined with respect to a smooth spectrum. When Fourier transformed, these out-of-phase oscillations induce percent-level shifts in the acoustic peak of the two-point correlation function. We present predictions for these shifts as a function of redshift; these should be considered as a robust lower limit to the more realistic case that includes, in addition, redshift distortions and galaxy bias. We show that these nonlinear effects occur at very large scales, leading to a breakdown of linear theory at scales much larger than commonly thought. We discuss why virialized halo profiles are not responsible for these effects, which can be understood from basic physics of gravitational instability. Our results are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, and can be used as a starting point for modeling baryon acoustic oscillations in future observations. To meet this end, we suggest a simple physically motivated model to correct for the shifts caused by mode coupling.},

	Abstract = {We develop a new approach to study the nonlinear evolution in the large-scale structure of the Universe both in real space and in redshift space, extending the standard perturbation theory of gravitational instability. Infinite series of terms in standard Eulerian perturbation theory are resummed as a result of our starting from a Lagrangian description of perturbations. Delicate nonlinear effects on scales of the baryon acoustic oscillations are more accurately described by our method than the standard one. Our approach differs from other resummation techniques recently proposed, such as the renormalized perturbation theory, etc., in that we use simple techniques and thus resulting equations are undemanding to evaluate, and in that our approach is capable of quantifying the nonlinear effects in redshift space. The power spectrum and correlation function of our approach are in good agreement with numerical simulations in literature on scales of baryon acoustic oscillations. Especially, nonlinear effects on the baryon acoustic peak of the correlation function are accurately described both in real space and in redshift space. Our approach provides a unique opportunity to analytically investigate the nonlinear effects on baryon acoustic scales in observable redshift space, which is requisite in constraining the nature of dark energy, the curvature of the Universe, etc., by redshift surveys.},

	Abstract = {We study the nonlinear propagator, a key ingredient in renormalized perturbation theory (RPT) that allows a well-controlled extension of perturbation theory into the nonlinear regime. We show that it can be thought as measuring the memory of density and velocity fields to their initial conditions. This provides a clean definition of the validity of linear theory, which is shown to be much more restricted than usually recognized in the literature. We calculate the nonlinear propagator in RPT and compare to measurements in numerical simulations, showing remarkable agreement well into the nonlinear regime. We also show that N-body simulations require a rather large volume to recover the correct propagator, due to the missing large-scale modes. Our results for the nonlinear propagator provide an essential element to compute the nonlinear power spectrum in RPT.},

@article{Taruya09,
	Abstract = {We study the nonlinear evolution of baryon acoustic oscillations in the matter power spectrum and correlation function from the improved perturbation theory (PT). Based on the framework of renormalized PT, which provides a nonperturbative way to treat the gravitational clustering of large-scale structure, we apply the closure approximation that truncates the infinite series of loop contributions at one-loop order, and obtain a closed set of integral equations for power spectrum and nonlinear propagator. The resultant integral expressions are basically equivalent to those previously derived in the form of evolution equations, and they keep important nonperturbative properties which can dramatically improve the prediction of nonlinear power spectrum. Employing the Born approximation, we then derive the analytic expressions for nonlinear power spectrum and the predictions are made for nonlinear evolution of baryon acoustic oscillations in power spectrum and correlation function. We find that the improved PT possesses a better convergence property compared with standard PT calculation. A detailed comparison between improved PT results and N-body simulations shows that a percent-level agreement is achieved in a certain range in power spectrum and in a rather wider range in correlation function. Combining a model of nonlinear redshift-space distortion, we also evaluate the power spectrum and correlation function in redshift space. In contrast to the results in real space, the agreement between N-body simulations and improved PT predictions tends to be worse, and a more elaborate modeling for redshift-space distortion needs to be developed. Nevertheless, with the currently existing model, we find that the prediction of correlation function has a sufficient accuracy compared with the cosmic-variance errors for future galaxy surveys with volume of a few h-3Gpc3 at z≳0.5.},

@article{cubep3m,
	Abstract = {This paper presents CUBEP3M, a publicly available high-performance cosmological N-body code and describes many utilities and extensions that have been added to the standard package. These include a memory-light runtime spherical overdensity halo finder, a non-Gaussian initial conditions generator and a system of unique particle identification. CUBEP3M is fast, its accuracy is tuneable to optimize speed or memory and has been run on more than 27 000 cores, achieving within a factor of 2 of ideal weak scaling even at this problem size. The code can be run in an extra-lean mode where the peak memory imprint for large runs is as low as 37 bytes per particles, which is almost two times leaner than other widely used N-body codes. However, load imbalances can increase this requirement by a factor of 2, such that fast configurations with all the utilities enabled and load imbalances factored in require between 70 and 120 bytes per particles. CUBEP3M is well designed to study large-scale cosmological systems, where imbalances are not too large and adaptive time-stepping not essential. It has already been used for a broad number of science applications that require either large samples of non-linear realizations or very large dark matter N-body simulations, including cosmological reionization, halo formation, baryonic acoustic oscillations, weak lensing or non-Gaussian statistics. We discuss the structure, the accuracy, known systematic effects and the scaling performance of the code and its utilities, when applicable.},

@article{Pen95,
	Abstract = {We present the theory, algorithm, and numerical experiments for the implementation of a new N-body algorithm, called APM. It scales linearly with the number of particles for the computational effort per time step. The resolution is fully adaptive, with a typical smoothing length comparable to the local interparticle separation. This is accomplished through the use of a dynamical coordinate system, which adjusts itself to the local density distribution. For the Poisson solver a multigrid iteration scheme is used. The scheme is fully data parallel and data local.  A specific implementation of this algorithm is described which is available to the astrophysics community. It is optimized for scalar, vector, and shared memory parallel machines. Performance characteristics are compared to traditional particle-mesh (PM) algorithms. The algorithm inherently has a threefold higher computing cost than the PM method with the same number of grid cells, but offers much higher resolution, and currently appears to be amongst the fastest adaptive high-resolution N-body algorithms.},

	Abstract = {An algorithm for simulating self-gravitating cosmological astrophysical fluids is presented. The advantages include a large dynamic range, parallelizability, high resolution per grid element, and fast execution speed. The code is based on a finite volume flux-conservative total variation diminishing (TVD) scheme for the shock-capturing hydro and an iterative multigrid solver for the gravity. The grid is a time-dependent field, whose motion is described by a generalized potential flow. Approximately constant mass per cell can be obtained, which provides all the advantages of a Lagrangian scheme. The grid deformation combined with appropriate limiting and smoothing schemes guarantees a regular and well-behaved grid geometry, in which nearest neighbor relationships remain constant. The full hydrodynamic fluid equations are implemented in the curvilinear moving grid, which allows for arbitrary fluid flow relative to the grid geometry. This combination retains all the advantages of the grid-based schemes including high speed per fluid element and a rapid gravity solver.  The current implementation is described, and empirical simulation results are presented. Accurate execution speed calculations are given in terms of floating point operations per time step per grid cell. This code is freely available to the community.},

	Abstract = {Gravitational non-linear evolution induces a shift in the position of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) peak together with a damping and broadening of its shape that bias and degrades the accuracy with which the position of the peak can be determined. BAO reconstruction is a technique developed to undo part of the effect of non-linearities. We present a new reconstruction method that consists in displacing pixels instead of galaxies and whose implementation is easier than the standard reconstruction method. We show that our method is equivalent to the standard reconstruction technique in the limit where the number of pixels becomes very large. This method is particularly useful in surveys where individual galaxies are not resolved, as in 21cm intensity mapping observations. We validate our method by reconstructing mock pixelated maps, that we build from the distribution of matter and halos in real- and redshift-space, from a large set of numerical simulations. We find that our method is able to decrease the uncertainty in the BAO peak position by 30-50% over the typical angular resolution scales of 21 cm intensity mapping experiments.},

@article{Schmittfull15,
	Abstract = {As galaxy surveys begin to measure the imprint of baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) on large-scale structure at the subpercent level, reconstruction techniques that reduce the contamination from nonlinear clustering become increasingly important. Inverting the nonlinear continuity equation, we propose an Eulerian growth-shift reconstruction algorithm that does not require the displacement of any objects, which is needed for the standard Lagrangian BAO reconstruction algorithm. In real-space dark matter-only simulations the algorithm yields 95% of the BAO signal-to-noise obtained from standard reconstruction. The reconstructed power spectrum is obtained by adding specific simple 3- and 4-point statistics to the prereconstruction power spectrum, making it very transparent how additional BAO information from higher-point statistics is included in the power spectrum through the reconstruction process. Analytical models of the reconstructed density for the two algorithms agree at second order. Based on similar modeling efforts, we introduce four additional reconstruction algorithms and discuss their performance.},

@article{Mehta11,
	Abstract = {The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the clustering of matter in the universe serves as a robust standard ruler and hence can be used to map the expansion history of the universe. We use high force resolution simulations to analyze the effects of galaxy bias on the measurements of the BAO signal. We apply a variety of Halo Occupation Distributions (HODs) and produce biased mass tracers to mimic different galaxy populations. We investigate whether galaxy bias changes the nonlinear shifts on the acoustic scale relative to the underlying dark matter distribution presented by Seo et al. For the less biased HOD models (b < 3), we do not detect any shift in the acoustic scale relative to the no-bias case, typically 0.10% $\pm$ 0.10%. However, the most biased HOD models (b > 3) show a shift at moderate significance (0.79% $\pm$ 0.31% for the most extreme case). We test the one-step reconstruction technique introduced by Eisenstein et al. in the case of realistic galaxy bias and shot noise. The reconstruction scheme increases the correlation between the initial and final (z = 1) density fields, achieving an equivalent level of correlation at nearly twice the wavenumber after reconstruction. Reconstruction reduces the shifts and errors on the shifts. We find that after reconstruction the shifts from the galaxy cases and the dark matter case are consistent with each other and with no shift. The 1sigma systematic errors on the distance measurements inferred from our BAO measurements with various HODs after reconstruction are about 0.07%-0.15%.},

@article{Seo10,
	Abstract = {We measure shifts of the acoustic scale due to nonlinear growth and redshift distortions to a high precision using a very large volume of high-force-resolution simulations. We compare results from various sets of simulations that differ in their force, volume, and mass resolution. We find a consistency within 1.5sigma for shift values from different simulations and derive shift alpha(z) - 1 = (0.300 $\pm$ 0.015) %[D(z)/D(0)]2 using our fiducial set. We find a strong correlation with a non-unity slope between shifts in real space and in redshift space and a weak correlation between the initial redshift and low redshift. Density-field reconstruction not only removes the mean shifts and reduces errors on the mean, but also tightens the correlations. After reconstruction, we recover a slope of near unity for the correlation between the real and redshift space and restore a strong correlation between the initial and the low redshifts. We derive propagators and mode-coupling terms from our N-body simulations and compare with the Zel'dovich approximation and the shifts measured from the chi2 fitting, respectively. We interpret the propagator and the mode-coupling term of a nonlinear density field in the context of an average and a dispersion of its complex Fourier coefficients relative to those of the linear density field; from these two terms, we derive a signal-to-noise ratio of the acoustic peak measurement. We attempt to improve our reconstruction method by implementing 2LPT and iterative operations, but we obtain little improvement. The Fisher matrix estimates of uncertainty in the acoustic scale is tested using 5000 h -3 Gpc3 of cosmological Particle-Mesh simulations from Takahashi et al. At an expected sample variance level of 1%, the agreement between the Fisher matrix estimates based on Seo and Eisenstein and the N-body results is better than 10%.},

	Abstract = {We present high signal-to-noise ratio measurements of the acoustic scale in the presence of nonlinear growth and redshift distortions using 320 h-3 Gpc 3 of cosmological particle-mesh simulations. Using simple fitting methods, we obtain robust measurements of the acoustic scale with scatter close to that predicted by the Fisher matrix. We detect and quantify the shift in the acoustic scale by analyzing the power spectrum: we detect at greater than 5 sigma a decrease in the acoustic scale in the real-space matter power spectrum of 0.2% at z = 1.5, growing to 0.45% at z = 0.3. In redshift space, the shifts are about 25% larger: we detect a decrease of 0.25% at z = 1.5 and 0.54% at z = 0.3. Despite the nonzero amounts, these shifts are highly predictable numerically, and hence removable within the standard ruler analysis of clustering data. Moreover, we show that a simple density field reconstruction method substantially reduces the scatter and nonlinear shifts of the acoustic scale measurements: the shifts are reduced to less than 0.1% at z = 0.3-1.5, even in the presence of nonnegligible shot noise. Finally, we show that the ratio of the cosmological distance to the sound horizon that would be inferred from these fits is robust to variations in the parameterization of the fitting method and reasonable differences in the template cosmology.},

	Abstract = {The density field reconstruction technique, which partially reverses the non-linear degradation of the Baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the galaxy redshift surveys, has been successful in substantially improving the cosmology constraints from recent surveys such as Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We estimate the efficiency of the method as a function of various reconstruction details. To directly quantify the BAO information in non-linear density fields before and after reconstruction, we calculate the cross-correlations (i.e. propagators) of the pre(post)-reconstructed density field with the initial linear field using a mock sample that mimics the clustering of the BOSS galaxies. The results directly provide the BAO damping as a function of wavenumber that can be implemented into the Fisher matrix analysis. We focus on investigating the dependence of the propagator on a choice of smoothing filters and on two major different conventions of the redshift-space density field reconstruction that have been used in literature. By estimating the BAO signal to noise for each case, we predict constraints on the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter using the Fisher matrix analysis. We thus determine an optimal Gaussian smoothing filter scale for the signal-to-noise level of the BOSS CMASS. We also present appropriate BAO fitting models for different reconstruction methods based on the first- and second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory in Fourier space. Using the mock data, we show that the modified BAO fitting model can substantially improve the accuracy of the BAO position in the best fits as well as the goodness of the fits.},

The BAO peak may be sharpened using the technique of density-field reconstruction, in which the bulk displacements of galaxies are estimated using a Zel'dovitch approximation. We use numerical simulations to demonstrate how the accuracy of this approximation depends strongly on local environment, and how this information may be used to construct an improved BAO measurement through environmental reweighting and using higher-order perturbation theory.

	Abstract = {The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the large-scale structure of the universe leave a distinct peak in the two-point correlation function of the matter distribution. That acoustic peak is smeared and shifted by bulk flows and non-linear evolution. However, it has been shown that it is still possible to sharpen the peak and remove its shift by undoing the effects of the bulk flows. We propose an improvement to the standard acoustic peak reconstruction. Contrary to the standard approach, the new scheme has no free parameters, treats the large-scale modes consistently, and uses optimal filters to extract the BAO information. At redshift of zero, the reconstructed linear matter power spectrum leads to a markedly improved sharpening of the reconstructed acoustic peak compared to standard reconstruction.},

The acoustic feature in the large-scale correlation function of galaxies imprinted by sound waves in the early Universe has been successfully used as a `standard ruler' to constrain the expansion history of the Universe. The standard ruler can be improved if a process known as density field reconstruction is employed. In this paper, we develop the Zeldovich formalism to compute the correlation function of biased tracers in both real and redshift space using the simplest reconstruction algorithm with a Gaussian kernel and compare to N-body simulations. The model qualitatively describes the effects of reconstruction on the simulations, though its quantitative success depends upon how redshift-space distortions are handled in the reconstruction algorithm.},

	Abstract = {The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) method for constraining the expansion history is adversely affected by nonlinear structure formation, which washes out the correlation function peak created at decoupling. To increase the constraining power of low z baryon acoustic oscillation experiments, it has been proposed that one use the observed distribution of galaxies to ``reconstruct'' the acoustic peak. Recently Padmanabhan, White, and Cohn provided an analytic formalism for understanding how reconstruction works within the context of Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT). We extend that formalism to include the case of biased tracers of the mass in real space and, because the quantitative validity of LPT is questionable, we investigate reconstruction in N-body simulations. We find that LPT does a good job of explaining the trends seen in simulations for both the mass and for biased tracers in real space and comment upon the implications this has for reconstruction.},

	Abstract = {Recently Eisenstein and collaborators introduced a method to ``reconstruct'' the linear power spectrum from a nonlinearly evolved galaxy distribution in order to improve precision in measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. We reformulate this method within the Lagrangian picture of structure formation, to better understand what such a method does, and what the resulting power spectra are. We show that reconstruction does not reproduce the linear density field, at second order. We however show that it does reduce the damping of the oscillations due to nonlinear structure formation, explaining the improvements seen in simulations. Our results suggest that the reconstructed power spectrum is potentially better modeled as the sum of three different power spectra, each dominating over different wavelength ranges and with different nonlinear damping terms. Finally, we also show that reconstruction reduces the mode-coupling term in the power spectrum, explaining why miscalibrations of the acoustic scale are reduced when one considers the reconstructed power spectrum.},

	Abstract = {We present measurements of the angular diameter distance DA(z) and the Hubble parameter H(z) at z = 0.35 using the anisotropy of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal measured in the galaxy clustering distribution of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7) luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample. Our work is the first to apply density-field reconstruction to an anisotropic analysis of the acoustic peak. Reconstruction partially removes the effects of non-linear evolution and redshift-space distortions in order to sharpen the acoustic signal. We present the theoretical framework behind the anisotropic BAO signal and give a detailed account of the fitting model we use to extract this signal from the data. Our method focuses only on the acoustic peak anisotropy, rather than the more model-dependent anisotropic information from the broad-band power. We test the robustness of our analysis methods on 160 Large Suite of Dark Matter Simulation DR7 mock catalogues and find that our models are unbiased at the ˜0.2 per cent level in measuring the BAO anisotropy. After reconstruction we measure DA(z = 0.35) = 1050 $\pm$ 38 Mpc and H(z = 0.35) = 84.4 $\pm$ 7.0 km s-1 Mpc-1 assuming a sound horizon of rs = 152.76 Mpc. Note that these measurements are correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0.57. This represents a factor of 1.4 improvement in the error on DA relative to the pre-reconstruction case; a factor of 1.2 improvement is seen for H.},

	Abstract = {We analyse the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal of the final Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data release (DR12). Our analysis is performed in Fourier-space, using the power spectrum monopole and quadrupole. The dataset includes $1\,198\,006$ galaxies over the redshift range $0.2 < z < 0.75$. We divide this dataset into three (overlapping) redshift bins with the effective redshifts $\zeff = 0.38$, $0.51$ and $0.61$. We demonstrate the reliability of our analysis pipeline using N-body simulations as well as $\sim 1000$ MultiDark-Patchy mock catalogues, which mimic the BOSS-DR12 target selection. We apply density field reconstruction to enhance the BAO signal-to-noise ratio. By including the power spectrum quadrupole we can separate the line-of-sight and angular modes, which allows us to constrain the angular diameter distance $D_A(z)$ and the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ separately. We obtain two independent $1.6\%$ and $1.5\%$ constraints on $D_A(z)$ and $2.9\%$ and $2.3\%$ constraints on $H(z)$ for the low ($\zeff=0.38$) and high ($\zeff=0.61$) redshift bin, respectively. We obtain two independent $1\%$ and $0.9\%$ constraints on the angular averaged distance $D_V(z)$, when ignoring the Alcock-Paczynski effect. The detection significance of the BAO signal is of the order of $8\sigma$ (post-reconstruction) for each of the three redshift bins. Our results are in good agreement with the Planck prediction within $\Lambda$CDM. This paper is part of a set that analyses the final galaxy clustering dataset from BOSS. The measurements and likelihoods presented here are combined with others in~\citet{Alam2016} to produce the final cosmological constraints from BOSS.},

	Abstract = {We present results from the 2D anisotropic Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal present in the final dataset from the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. We analyse the WiggleZ data in two ways: firstly using the full shape of the 2D correlation function and secondly focussing only on the position of the BAO peak in the reconstructed data set. When fitting for the full shape of the 2D correlation function we use a multipole expansion to compare with theory. When we use the reconstructed data we marginalise over the shape and just measure the position of the BAO peak, analysing the data in wedges separating the signal along the line of sight from that parallel to the line of sight. We verify our method with mock data and find the results to be free of bias or systematic offsets. We also redo the pre-reconstruction angle averaged (1D) WiggleZ BAO analysis with an improved covariance and present an updated result. The final results are presented in the form of $\Omega_c h^2$, $H(z)$, and $D_A(z)$ for three redshift bins with effective redshifts $z = 0.44$, $0.60$, and $0.73$. Within these bins and methodologies, we recover constraints between 5% and 22% error. Our cosmological constraints are consistent with Flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and agree with results from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS).},

	Abstract = {We study the large-scale clustering of galaxies in the overlap region of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS sample and the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. We calculate the auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions in the overlap region of the two data sets and detect a Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal in each of them. The BAO measurement from the cross-correlation function represents the first such detection between two different galaxy surveys. After applying density-field reconstruction we report distance-scale measurements D_V r_s^fid / r_s = (1970 $\pm$ 45, 2132 $\pm$ 65, 2100 $\pm$ 200) Mpc from CMASS, the cross-correlation and WiggleZ, respectively. The distance scales derived from the two data sets are consistent, and are also robust against switching the displacement fields used for reconstruction between the two surveys. We use correlated mock realizations to calculate the covariance between the three BAO constraints. This approach can be used to construct a correlation matrix, permitting for the first time a rigorous combination of WiggleZ and CMASS BAO measurements. Using a volume-scaling technique, our result can also be used to combine WiggleZ and future CMASS DR12 results. Finally, we show that the relative velocity effect, a possible source of systematic uncertainty for the BAO technique, is consistent with zero for our samples.},

	Abstract = {We present significant improvements in cosmic distance measurements from the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey, achieved by applying the reconstruction of the baryonic acoustic feature technique. We show using both data and simulations that the reconstruction technique can often be effective despite patchiness of the survey, significant edge effects and shot-noise. We investigate three redshift bins in the redshift range 0.2 < z < 1, and in all three find improvement after reconstruction in the detection of the baryonic acoustic feature and its usage as a standard ruler. We measure model-independent distance measures DV(rsfid/rs) of 1716 $\pm$ 83, 2221 $\pm$ 101, 2516 $\pm$ 86 Mpc (68 per cent CL) at effective redshifts z = 0.44, 0.6, 0.73, respectively, where DV is the volume-averaged distance, and rs is the sound horizon at the end of the baryon drag epoch. These significantly improved 4.8, 4.5 and 3.4 per cent accuracy measurements are equivalent to those expected from surveys with up to 2.5 times the volume of WiggleZ without reconstruction applied. These measurements are fully consistent with cosmologies allowed by the analyses of the Planck Collaboration and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We provide the DV(rsfid/rs) posterior probability distributions and their covariances. When combining these measurements with temperature fluctuations measurements of Planck, the polarization of Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 9, and the 6dF Galaxy Survey baryonic acoustic feature, we do not detect deviations from a flat Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) model. Assuming this model, we constrain the current expansion rate to H0 = 67.15 $\pm$ 0.98 km s-1Mpc-1. Allowing the equation of state of dark energy to vary, we obtain wDE = -1.080 $\pm$ 0.135. When assuming a curved LambdaCDM model we obtain a curvature value of OmegaK = -0.0043 $\pm$ 0.0047.},

	Abstract = {We present measurements of galaxy clustering from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), which is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III). These use the Data Release 9 (DR9) CMASS sample, which contains 264 283 massive galaxies covering 3275 square degrees with an effective redshift z = 0.57 and redshift range 0.43 < z < 0.7. Assuming a concordance LambdaCDM cosmological model, this sample covers an effective volume of 2.2 Gpc3, and represents the largest sample of the Universe ever surveyed at this density, n¯≈3×10-4 h-3 Mpc 3. We measure the angle-averaged galaxy correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of 5sigma in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Combining with the SDSS-II luminous red galaxy sample, the detection significance increases to 6.7sigma. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance to z = 0.57 relative to the sound horizon DV/rs = 13.67 $\pm$ 0.22 at z = 0.57. Assuming a fiducial sound horizon of 153.19 Mpc, which matches cosmic microwave background constraints, this corresponds to a distance DV (z = 0.57) = 2094 $\pm$ 34 Mpc. At 1.7 per cent, this is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. We place this result alongside previous BAO measurements in a cosmological distance ladder and find excellent agreement with the current supernova measurements. We use these distance measurements to constrain various cosmological models, finding continuing support for a flat Universe with a cosmological constant.},

	Abstract = {We create a sample of spectroscopically identified galaxies with z < 0.2 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7), covering 6813 deg2. Galaxies are chosen to sample the highest mass haloes, with an effective bias of 1.5, allowing us to construct 1000 mock galaxy catalogues (described in Paper II), which we use to estimate statistical errors and test our methods. We use an estimate of the gravitational potential to `reconstruct' the linear density fluctuations, enhancing the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal in the measured correlation function and power spectrum. Fitting to these measurements, we determine DV(zeff = 0.15) = (664 $\pm$ 25)(rd/rd, fid) Mpc; this is a better than 4 per cent distance measurement. This `fills the gap' in BAO distance ladder between previously measured local and higher redshift measurements, and affords significant improvement in constraining the properties of dark energy. Combining our measurement with other BAO measurements from Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey and 6-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey galaxy samples provides a 15 per cent improvement in the determination of the equation of state of dark energy and the value of the Hubble parameter at z = 0 (H0). Our measurement is fully consistent with the Planck results and the Lambda cold dark matter concordance cosmology, but increases the tension between Planck+BAO H0 determinations and direct H0 measurements.},

@article{Padmanabhan12,
	Abstract = {We present the first application to density field reconstruction to a galaxy survey to undo the smoothing of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature due to non-linear gravitational evolution and thereby improve the precision of the distance measurements possible. We apply the reconstruction technique to the clustering of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7) luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample, sharpening the BAO feature and achieving a 1.9 per cent measurement of the distance to z = 0.35. We update the reconstruction algorithm of Eisenstein et al. to account for the effects of survey geometry as well as redshift-space distortions and validate it on 160 LasDamas simulations. We demonstrate that reconstruction sharpens the BAO feature in the angle averaged galaxy correlation function, reducing the non-linear smoothing scale Sigmanl from 8.1 to 4.4 Mpc h-1. Reconstruction also significantly reduces the effects of redshift-space distortions at the BAO scale, isotropizing the correlation function. This sharpened BAO feature yields an unbiased distance estimate (<0.2 per cent) and reduces the scatter from 3.3 to 2.1 per cent. We demonstrate the robustness of these results to the various reconstruction parameters, including the smoothing scale, the galaxy bias and the linear growth rate. Applying this reconstruction algorithm to the SDSS LRG DR7 sample improves the significance of the BAO feature in these data from 3.3sigma for the unreconstructed correlation function to 4.2sigma after reconstruction. We estimate a relative distance scale DV/rs to z = 0.35 of 8.88 $\pm$ 0.17, where rs is the sound horizon and DV≡(DA2H-1)1/3 is a combination of the angular diameter distance DA and Hubble parameter H. Assuming a sound horizon of 154.25 Mpc, this translates into a distance measurement DV(z = 0.35) = 1.356 $\pm$ 0.025 Gpc. We find that reconstruction reduces the distance error in the DR7 sample from 3.5 to 1.9 per cent, equivalent to a survey with three times the volume of SDSS.},

	Abstract = {We present a one per cent measurement of the cosmic distance scale from the detections of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of galaxies from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, which is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. Our results come from the Data Release 11 (DR11) sample, containing nearly one million galaxies and covering approximately 8500 square degrees and the redshift range 0.2 < z < 0.7. We also compare these results with those from the publicly released DR9 and DR10 samples. Assuming a concordance Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) cosmological model, the DR11 sample covers a volume of 13 Gpc3 and is the largest region of the Universe ever surveyed at this density. We measure the correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the BAO feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of over 7sigma in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance relative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, rd, which has a value of rd,fid = 149.28 Mpc in our fiducial cosmology. We find DV = (1264 $\pm$ 25 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) at z = 0.32 and DV = (2056 $\pm$ 20 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) at z = 0.57. At 1.0 per cent, this latter measure is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. Separating the clustering along and transverse to the line of sight yields measurements at z = 0.57 of DA = (1421 $\pm$ 20 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) and H = (96.8 $\pm$ 3.4 km s-1 Mpc-1)(rd,fid/rd). Our measurements of the distance scale are in good agreement with previous BAO measurements and with the predictions from cosmic microwave background data for a spatially flat CDM model with a cosmological constant.},

@article{Eisenstein07,
	Abstract = {The baryon acoustic oscillations are a promising route to the precision measure of the cosmological distance scale and hence the measurement of the time evolution of dark energy. We show that the nonlinear degradation of the acoustic signature in the correlations of low-redshift galaxies is a correctable process. By suitable reconstruction of the linear density field, one can sharpen the acoustic peak in the correlation function or, equivalently, restore the higher harmonics of the oscillations in the power spectrum. With this, one can achieve better measurements of the acoustic scale for a given survey volume. Reconstruction is particularly effective at low redshift, where the nonlinearities are worse but where the dark energy density is highest. At z=0.3, we find that one can reduce the sample variance error bar on the acoustic scale by at least a factor of 2 and in principle by nearly a factor of 4. We discuss the significant implications our results have for the design of galaxy surveys aimed at measuring the distance scale through the acoustic peak.},

	Abstract = {Reconstruction techniques are commonly used in cosmology to reduce complicated nonlinear behaviour to a more tractable linearized system. We study the Moving-Mesh algorithm which is expected to perform better than many alternatives as it is based in Lagrangian space. To quantify the algorithm's ability to reconstruct linear modes, we study the Fisher information presented in 136 N-body simulations before and after reconstruction. We find that the linear scale is pushed to $k\simeq$ 0.3 $h/\mathrm{Mpc}$ after reconstruction. We furthermore find that the translinear plateau of the cumulative Fisher information is increased by a factor of $\sim 40$ after reconstruction, from $I \simeq 2.5 \times 10^{-5} /(\mathrm{Mpc}^3/h^3)$ to $I \simeq 10^{-3}/(\mathrm{Mpc}^3/h^3)$ at $k \simeq$ 1 $h/\mathrm{Mpc}$. This includes the decorrelation between initial and final fields, which has been neglected in many previous studies, and we find that the log-normal transform in this metric only gains a factor of 4 in information. We expect this technique to be beneficial to problems such as baryonic acoustic oscillations and cosmic neutrinos that rely on an accurate disentangling of nonlinear evolution from underlying linear effects.},

We solve for the unique displacement potential consistent with the non-linear density and positive definite coordinate transformation using a multigrid algorithm. We show that we recover the linear initial conditions up to $k\sim 1\ h/\mathrm{Mpc}$ with minimal computational cost. This reconstruction approach generalizes the linear displacement theory to fully non-linear fields, potentially substantially expanding the BAO and RSD information content of dense large scale structure surveys, including for example SDSS main sample and 21cm intensity mapping.},

	Abstract = {21 cm intensity mapping has emerged as a promising technique to map the large-scale structure of the Universe, at redshifts $z$ from 1 to 10. Unfortunately, many of the key cross correlations with photo-$z$ galaxies and the CMB have been thought to be impossible due to foreground contamination for radial modes with small wavenumbers. These modes are usually subtracted in the foreground subtraction process. We recover the lost 21 cm radial modes via cosmic tidal reconstruction and find more than 60\% cross-correlation signal at $\ell\lesssim100$ and even more on larger scales can be recovered from null. The tidal reconstruction method opens up a new set of possibilities to probe our Universe and is extremely valuable not only for 21 cm surveys but also for CMB and photometric redshift observations.},

This convolution picture produces exact correlation functions out to separations of L/2, where L is the box size, which is the maximum theoretically allowed. This method also produces top-hat sphere fluctuations that are exact at radii R<=L/4. It is equivalent to windowing the power spectrum with the simulation volume before discretizing, thus bypassing sparse sampling problems. The mean density perturbation in the volume is no longer constrained to be zero, allowing one to assemble a large simulation using a series of smaller ones. This is especially important for simulations of Lyalpha systems where small boxes with steep power spectra are routinely used.  We also present an extension of this procedure that generates exact initial conditions for hierarchical grids at negligible cost.},

	Abstract = {Simulating the evolution of the local universe is important for studying galaxies and the intergalactic medium in a way free of cosmic variance. Here we present a method to reconstruct the initial linear density field from an input nonlinear density field, employing the Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm combined with Particle-mesh (PM) dynamics. The HMC+PM method is applied to cosmological simulations, and the reconstructed linear density fields are then evolved to the present day with N-body simulations. These constrained simulations accurately reproduce both the amplitudes and phases of the input simulations at various z. Using a PM model with a grid cell size of 0.75 h -1 Mpc and 40 time steps in the HMC can recover more than half of the phase information down to a scale k ~ 0.85 h Mpc-1 at high z and to k ~ 3.4 h Mpc-1 at z = 0, which represents a significant improvement over similar reconstruction models in the literature, and indicates that our model can reconstruct the formation histories of cosmic structures over a large dynamical range. Adopting PM models with higher spatial and temporal resolutions yields even better reconstructions, suggesting that our method is limited more by the availability of computer resource than by principle. Dynamic models of structure evolution adopted in many earlier investigations can induce non-Gaussianity in the reconstructed linear density field, which in turn can cause large systematic deviations in the predicted halo mass function. Such deviations are greatly reduced or absent in our reconstruction.},

	Abstract = {Our research objective in this paper is to reconstruct an initial linear density field, which follows the multivariate Gaussian distribution with variances given by the linear power spectrum of the current cold dark matter model and evolves through gravitational instabilities to the present-day density field in the local universe. For this purpose, we develop a Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to obtain the linear density field from a posterior probability function that consists of two components: a prior of a Gaussian density field with a given linear spectrum and a likelihood term that is given by the current density field. The present-day density field can be reconstructed from galaxy groups using the method developed in Wang et al. Using a realistic mock Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7, obtained by populating dark matter halos in the Millennium simulation (MS) with galaxies, we show that our method can effectively and accurately recover both the amplitudes and phases of the initial, linear density field. To examine the accuracy of our method, we use N-body simulations to evolve these reconstructed initial conditions to the present day. The resimulated density field thus obtained accurately matches the original density field of the MS in the density range 0.3 \lesssim \rho /\bar{\rho } \lesssim 20 without any significant bias. In particular, the Fourier phases of the resimulated density fields are tightly correlated with those of the original simulation down to a scale corresponding to a wavenumber of ~1 h Mpc-1, much smaller than the translinear scale, which corresponds to a wavenumber of ~0.15 h Mpc-1.},

	Abstract = {We describe our methodology for comparing the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and other complementary data sets to theoretical models. The unprecedented quality of the WMAP data and the tight constraints on cosmological parameters that are derived require a rigorous analysis so that the approximations made in the modeling do not lead to significant biases. We describe our use of the likelihood function to characterize the statistical properties of the microwave background sky. We outline the use of the Monte Carlo Markov Chains to explore the likelihood of the data given a model to determine the best-fit cosmological parameters and their uncertainties. We add to the WMAP data the l>~700 Cosmic Background Imager (CBI) and Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver (ACBAR) measurements of the CMB, the galaxy power spectrum at z~0 obtained from the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS), and the matter power spectrum at z~3 as measured with the Lyalpha forest. These last two data sets complement the CMB measurements by probing the matter power spectrum of the nearby universe. Combining CMB and 2dFGRS requires that we include in our analysis a model for galaxy bias, redshift distortions, and the nonlinear growth of structure. We show how the statistical and systematic uncertainties in the model and the data are propagated through the full analysis.  WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.},

	Abstract = {We develop two methods for estimating the power spectrum, Cl, of the cosmic microwave background from data and apply them to the Cosmic Background Explorer Differential Microwave Radiometer and Saskatoon datasets. One method involves a direct evaluation of the likelihood function, and the other is an estimator that is a minimum-variance weighted quadratic function of the data. Applied iteratively, the quadratic estimator is not distinct from likelihood analysis, but is rather a rapid means of finding the power spectrum that maximizes the likelihood function. Our results bear this out: direct evaluation and quadratic estimation converge to the same Cls. The quadratic estimator can also be used to determine directly cosmological parameters and their uncertainties. While the two methods both require O(N3) operations, the quadratic is much faster, and both are applicable to datasets with arbitrary chopping patterns and noise correlations. We also discuss approximations that may reduce it to O(N2) thus making it practical for forthcoming megapixel datasets.},

	Abstract = {We derive an analytical expression for a novel large-scale structure observable: the line correlation function. The line correlation function, which is constructed from the three-point correlation function of the phase of the density field, is a robust statistical measure allowing the extraction of information in the nonlinear and non-Gaussian regime. We show that, in perturbation theory, the line correlation is sensitive to the coupling kernel F2, which governs the nonlinear gravitational evolution of the density field. We compare our analytical expression with results from numerical simulations and find a 1sigma agreement for separations r ≳ 30 h-1 Mpc. Fitting formulae for the power spectrum and the nonlinear coupling kernel at small scales allow us to extend our prediction into the strongly nonlinear regime, where we find a 1sigma agreement with the simulations for r ≳ 2 h-1 Mpc. We discuss the advantages of the line correlation relative to standard statistical measures like the bispectrum. Unlike the latter, the line correlation is independent of the bias, in the regime where the bias is local and linear. Furthermore, the variance of the line correlation is independent of the Gaussian variance on the modulus of the density field. This suggests that the line correlation can probe more precisely the nonlinear regime of gravity, with less contamination from the power spectrum variance.},

	Abstract = {The likelihood function for cosmological parameters, given by e.g. weak lensing shear measurements, depends on contributions to the covariance induced by the nonlinear evolution of the cosmic web. As nonlinear clustering to date has only been described by numerical $N$-body simulations in a reliable and sufficiently precise way, the necessary computational costs for estimating those covariances at different points in parameter space are tremendous. In this work we describe the change of the matter covariance and of the weak lensing covariance matrix as a function of cosmological parameters by constructing a suitable basis, where we model the contribution to the covariance from nonlinear structure formation using Eulerian perturbation theory at third order. We show that our formalism is capable of dealing with large matrices and reproduces expected degeneracies and scaling with cosmological parameters in a reliable way. Comparing our analytical results to numerical simulations we find that the method describes the variation of the covariance matrix found in the SUNGLASS weak lensing simulation pipeline within the errors at one-loop and tree-level for the spectrum and the trispectrum, respectively, for multipoles up to $\ell\leq 1300$. We show that it is possible to optimize the sampling of parameter space where numerical simulations should be carried out by minimising interpolation errors and propose a corresponding method to distribute points in parameter space in an economical way.},

	Abstract = {We derived constraints on cosmological parameters using weak lensing peak statistics measured on the ˜ 130 deg2 of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Stripe 82 Survey. This analysis demonstrates the feasibility of using peak statistics in cosmological studies. For our measurements, we considered peaks with signal-to-noise ratio in the range of nu = [3, 6]. For a flat Lambda cold dark matter model with only (Omegam, sigma8) as free parameters, we constrained the parameters of the following relation Sigma8 = sigma8(Omegam/0.27)alpha to be Sigma8 = 0.82 $\pm$ 0.03 and alpha = 0.43 $\pm$ 0.02. The alpha value found is considerably smaller than the one measured in two-point and three-point cosmic shear correlation analyses, showing a significant complement of peak statistics to standard weak lensing cosmological studies. The derived constraints on (Omegam, sigma8) are fully consistent with the ones from either WMAP9 or Planck. From the weak lensing peak abundances alone, we obtained marginalized mean values of Omega _m=0.38^{+0.27}_{-0.24} and sigma8 = 0.81 $\pm$ 0.26. Finally, we also explored the potential of using weak lensing peak statistics to constrain the mass-concentration relation of dark matter haloes simultaneously with cosmological parameters.},

@article{liujia15,
	Abstract = {Lensing peaks have been proposed as a useful statistic, containing cosmological information from non-Gaussianities that is inaccessible from traditional two-point statistics such as the power spectrum or two-point correlation functions. Here we examine constraints on cosmological parameters from weak lensing peak counts, using the publicly available data from the 154 deg2 CFHTLenS survey. We utilize a new suite of ray-tracing N-body simulations on a grid of 91 cosmological models covering broad ranges of the three parameters Omegam, sigma8, and w , and replicating the Galaxy sky positions, redshifts, and shape noise in the CFHTLenS observations. We then build an emulator that interpolates the power spectrum and the peak counts to an accuracy of <=5 %, and compute the likelihood in the three-dimensional parameter space (Omegam, sigma8, w ) from both observables. We find that constraints from peak counts are comparable to those from the power spectrum, and somewhat tighter when different smoothing scales are combined. Neither observable can constrain w without external data. When the power spectrum and peak counts are combined, the area of the error "banana" in the (Omegam, sigma8) plane reduces by a factor of ≈2 , compared to using the power spectrum alone. For a flat Lambda cold dark matter model, combining both statistics, we obtain the constraint sigma8(Omegam/0.27 )0.63=0.85-0.03+0.03 .},

@article{fanzh10,
	Abstract = {Taking into account noise from intrinsic ellipticities of source galaxies, in this paper, we study the peak statistics in weak-lensing convergence maps around clusters of galaxies and beyond. We emphasize how the noise peak statistics is affected by the density distribution of nearby clusters, and also how cluster-peak signals are changed by the existence of noise. These are the important aspects to be thoroughly understood in weak-lensing analyses for individual clusters as well as in cosmological applications of weak-lensing cluster statistics. We adopt Gaussian smoothing with the smoothing scale theta G  = 0.5arcmin in our analyses. It is found that the noise peak distribution near a cluster of galaxies sensitively depends on the density profile of the cluster. For a cored isothermal cluster with the core radius Rc , the inner region with R <= Rc appears noisy containing on average ~2.4 peaks with nu >= 5 for Rc = 1.7arcmin and the true peak height of the cluster nu = 5.6, where nu denotes the convergence signal-to-noise ratio. For a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) cluster of the same mass and the same central nu, the average number of peaks with nu >= 5 within R <= Rc is ~1.6. Thus a high peak corresponding to the main cluster can be identified more cleanly in the NFW case. In the outer region with Rc < R <= 5Rc , the number of high noise peaks is considerably enhanced in comparison with that of the pure noise case without the nearby cluster. For nu >= 4, depending on the treatment of the mass-sheet degeneracy in weak-lensing analyses, the enhancement factor f is in the range of ~5 to ~55 for both clusters as their outer density profiles are similar. The properties of the main-cluster-peak identified in convergence maps are also significantly affected by the presence of noise. Scatters as well as a systematic shift for the peak height are present. The height distribution is peaked at nu ~ 6.6, rather than at nu = 5.6, corresponding to a shift of Deltanu ~ 1, for the isothermal cluster. For the NFW cluster, Deltanu ~ 0.8. The existence of noise also causes a location offset for the weak-lensing identified main-cluster-peak with respect to the true center of the cluster. The offset distribution is very broad and extends to R ~ Rc for the isothermal case. For the NFW cluster, it is relatively narrow and peaked at R ~ 0.2Rc . We also analyze NFW clusters of different concentrations. It is found that the more centrally concentrated the mass distribution of a cluster is, the less its weak-lensing signal is affected by noise. Incorporating these important effects and the mass function of NFW dark matter halos, we further present a model calculating the statistical abundances of total convergence peaks, true and false ones, over a large field beyond individual clusters. The results are in good agreement with those from numerical simulations. The model then allows us to probe cosmologies with the convergence peaks directly without the need of expensive follow-up observations to differentiate true and false peaks.},

As our formula requires the three-point shear correlation function, we also present an efficient tree-based algorithm for measuring it. We show how our algorithm would scale in computing time and memory usage for future lensing surveys. We also apply the procedure to our Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) survey data, originally described by Jarvis et al. We find that the skewness is positive (inconsistent with zero) at the 2sigma level. However, the signal is too noisy from this data to usefully constrain cosmology.},

	Abstract = {Higher order, non-Gaussian aspects of the large-scale structure carry valuable information on structure formation and cosmology, which is complementary to second-order statistics. In this work, we measure second- and third-order weak-lensing aperture-mass moments from the Canada-France-Hawaii Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) and combine those with cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy probes. The third moment is measured with a significance of 2sigma. The combined constraint on Sigma8 = sigma8(Omegam/0.27)alpha is improved by 10 per cent, in comparison to the second-order only, and the allowed ranges for Omegam and sigma8 are substantially reduced. Including general triangles of the lensing bispectrum yields tighter constraints compared to probing mainly equilateral triangles. Second- and third-order CFHTLenS lensing measurements improve Planck CMB constraints on Omegam and sigma8 by 26 per cent for flat Lambda cold dark matter. For a model with free curvature, the joint CFHTLenS-Planck result is Omegam = 0.28 $\pm$ 0.02 (68 per cent confidence), which is an improvement of 43 per cent compared to Planck alone. We test how our results are potentially subject to three astrophysical sources of contamination: source-lens clustering, the intrinsic alignment of galaxy shapes, and baryonic effects. We explore future limitations of the cosmological use of third-order weak lensing, such as the non-linear model and the Gaussianity of the likelihood function.},

@article{Huterer06,
	Abstract = {We study the impact of systematic errors on planned weak-lensing surveys and compute the requirements on their contributions so that they are not a dominant source of the cosmological parameter error budget. The generic types of error we consider are multiplicative and additive errors in measurements of shear, as well as photometric redshift errors. In general, more powerful surveys have stronger systematic requirements. For example, for a SuperNova/Acceleration Probe (SNAP)-type survey the multiplicative error in shear needs to be smaller than 1 per cent of the mean shear in any given redshift bin, while the centroids of photometric redshift bins need to be known to be better than 0.003. With about a factor of 2 degradation in cosmological parameter errors, future surveys can enter a self-calibration regime, where the mean systematic biases are self-consistently determined from the survey and only higher order moments of the systematics contribute. Interestingly, once the power-spectrum measurements are combined with the bispectrum, the self-calibration regime in the variation of the equation of state of dark energy wa is attained with only a 20-30 per cent error degradation.},

@article{Takahashi09,
	Abstract = {We use 5000 cosmological N-body simulations of 1 h -3 Gpc3 box for the concordance LambdaCDM model in order to study the sampling variances of a nonlinear matter power spectrum. We show that the non-Gaussian errors can be important even on large length scales relevant for baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). Our findings are the following: (1) the non-Gaussian errors degrade the cumulative signal-to-noise ratios (S/Ns) for the power spectrum amplitude by up to a factor of 2 and 4 for redshifts z = 1 and 0, respectively; (2) there is little information on the power spectrum amplitudes in the quasi-nonlinear regime, confirming the previous results; (3) the distribution of power spectrum estimators at BAO scales, among the realizations, is well approximated by a Gaussian distribution with variance that is given by the diagonal covariance component. (4) For the redshift-space power spectrum, the degradation in S/N by non-Gaussian errors is mitigated due to nonlinear redshift distortions; (5) for an actual galaxy survey, the additional shot noise contamination compromises the cosmological information inherent in the galaxy power spectrum, but also mitigates the impact of non-Gaussian errors. The S/N is degraded by up to 30% for a Wide-Field Fiber-Fed Optical Multi-Object Spectrograph-type survey; (6) the finite survey volume causes additional non-Gaussian errors via the correlations of long-wavelength fluctuations with the fluctuations we want to measure, further degrading the S/N values by about 30% even at high redshift z = 3.},

@article{Clerkin16,
	Abstract = {It is well known that the probability distribution function (PDF) of galaxy density contrast is approximately lognormal; whether the PDF of mass fluctuations derived from weak lensing convergence (kappa_WL) is lognormal is less well established. We derive PDFs of the galaxy and projected matter density distributions via the Counts in Cells (CiC) method. We use maps of galaxies and weak lensing convergence produced from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Science Verification data over 139 deg^2. We test whether the underlying density contrast is well described by a lognormal distribution for the galaxies, the convergence and their joint PDF. We confirm that the galaxy density contrast distribution is well modeled by a lognormal PDF convolved with Poisson noise at angular scales from 10-40 arcmin (corresponding to physical scales of 3-10 Mpc). We note that as kappa_WL is a weighted sum of the mass fluctuations along the line of sight, its PDF is expected to be only approximately lognormal. We find that the kappa_WL distribution is well modeled by a lognormal PDF convolved with Gaussian shape noise at scales between 10 and 20 arcmin, with a best-fit chi^2/DOF of 1.11 compared to 1.84 for a Gaussian model, corresponding to p-values 0.35 and 0.07 respectively, at a scale of 10 arcmin. Above 20 arcmin a simple Gaussian model is sufficient. The joint PDF is also reasonably fitted by a bivariate lognormal. As a consistency check we compare the variances derived from the lognormal modelling with those directly measured via CiC. Our methods are validated against maps from the MICE Grand Challenge N-body simulation.},

	Abstract = {We evaluate the success of linear tidal-torque theory (TTT) in predicting galactic-halo spin using a cosmological N -body simulation with thousands of well-resolved haloes. The protohaloes are identified by tracing today's haloes back to the initial conditions. The TTT predictions for the protohaloes match, on average, the spin amplitudes of the virialized haloes of today, if linear growth is assumed until ~t 0 /3, or 55-70 per cent of the halo effective turn-around time. This makes it a useful qualitative tool for understanding certain average properties of galaxies, such as total spin and angular momentum distribution within haloes, but with a random scatter of the order of the signal itself. Non-linear changes in spin direction cause a mean error of ~50$\,^{\circ}$ in the TTT prediction at t 0 , such that the linear spatial correlations of spins on scales >=1h -1 Mpc are significantly weakened by non-linear effects. This questions the usefulness of TTT for predicting intrinsic alignments in the context of gravitational lensing. We find that the standard approximations made in TTT, including a second-order expansion of the Zel'dovich potential and a smoothing of the tidal field, provide close-to-optimal results.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the cross-talk between the two key components of tidal-torque theory, the inertia ( I ) and shear ( T ) tensors, using a cosmological N -body simulation with thousands of well-resolved haloes. We find that the principal axes of I and T are strongly aligned , even though I characterizes the protohalo locally while T is determined by the large-scale structure. Thus, the resultant galactic spin, which plays a key role in galaxy formation, is only a residual due to ~10 per cent deviations from the perfect alignment of T and I . The T - I correlation induces a weak tendency for the protohalo spin to be perpendicular to the major axes of T and I , but this correlation is erased by non-linear effects at late times, making the observed spins poor indicators of the initial shear field. However, the T - I correlation implies that the shear tensor can be used for identifying the positions and boundaries of protohaloes in cosmological initial conditions - a missing piece in galaxy formation theory. The typical configuration is of a prolate protohalo lying perpendicular to a large-scale high-density ridge, with the surrounding voids inducing compression along the major and intermediate inertia axes of the protohalo. This leads to a transient sub-halo filament along the large-scale ridge, whose subclumps then flow along the filament and merge into the final halo. The centres of protohaloes tend to lie in ~1sigma overdensity regions, but their association with linear density maxima smoothed on galactic scales is vague: only ~40 per cent of the protohaloes contain peaks. Several other characteristics distinguish protohaloes from density peaks, e.g. they tend to compress along two principal axes while many peaks compress along three axes.},

@article{wangyang14,
	Abstract = {Observations have shown that the spatial distribution of satellite galaxies is not random, but aligned with the major axes of central galaxies. This alignment is dependent on galaxy properties, such that red satellites are more strongly aligned than blue satellites. Theoretical work conducted to interpret this phenomenon has found that it is due to the non-spherical nature of dark matter halos. However, most studies overpredict the alignment signal under the assumption that the central galaxy shape follows the shape of the host halo. It is also not clear whether the color dependence of alignment is due to an assembly bias or an evolution effect. In this paper we study these problems using a cosmological N-body simulation. Subhalos are used to trace the positions of satellite galaxies. It is found that the shapes of dark matter halos are mis-aligned at different radii. If the central galaxy shares the same shape as the inner host halo, then the alignment effect is weaker and agrees with observational data. However, it predicts almost no dependence of alignment on the color of satellite galaxies, though the late accreted subhalos show stronger alignment with the outer layer of the host halo than their early accreted counterparts. We find that this is due to the limitation of pure N-body simulations where satellite galaxies without associated subhalos ("orphan galaxies") are not resolved. These orphan (mostly red) satellites often reside in the inner region of host halos and should follow the shape of the host halo in the inner region.},

@article{guohong09,
	Abstract = {We use a set of numerical N-body simulations to study the large-scale behavior of the reduced bispectrum of dark matter and compare the results with the second-order perturbation theory and the halo models for different halo mass functions. We find that the second-order perturbation theory (PT2) agrees with the simulations fairly well on large scales of k < 0.05 h Mpc-1, but it shows a signature of deviation as the scale goes down. Even on the largest scale where the bispectrum can be measured reasonably well in our simulations, the inconsistency between PT2 and the simulations appears for the colinear triangle shapes. For the halo model, we find that it can only serve as a qualitative method to help study the behavior of Q on large scales and also on relatively small scales. The failure of second-order perturbation theory will also affect the precise determination of the halo models, since they are connected through the 3-halo term in the halo model. The 2-halo term has too much contribution on the large scales, which is the main reason for the halo model to overpredict the bispectrum on the large scales. Since neither of the models can provide a satisfying description for the bispectrum on scales k ~ 0.1 h Mpc-1 for the requirement of precision cosmology, we release the reduced bispectrum of dark matter on a large range of scales for future analytical modeling of the bispectrum.},

@article{Xavier16,
	Abstract = {It is common practice in cosmology to model large-scale structure observables as lognormal random fields, and this approach has been successfully applied in the past to the matter density and weak lensing convergence fields separately. We argue that this approach has fundamental limitations which prevent its use for jointly modelling these two fields since the lognormal distribution's shape can prevent certain correlations to be attainable. Given the need of ongoing and future large-scale structure surveys for fast joint simulations of clustering and weak lensing, we propose two ways of overcoming these limitations. The first approach slightly distorts the power spectra of the fields using one of two algorithms that minimises either the absolute or the fractional distortions. The second one is by obtaining more accurate convergence marginal distributions, for which we provide a fitting function, by integrating the lognormal density along the line of sight. The latter approach also provides a way to determine directly from theory the skewness of the convergence distribution and, therefore, the parameters for a lognormal fit. We present the public code Full-sky Lognormal Astro-fields Simulation Kit (FLASK) which can make tomographic realisations on the sphere of an arbitrary number of correlated lognormal or Gaussian random fields by applying either of the two proposed solutions, and show that it can create joint simulations of clustering and lensing with sub-per-cent accuracy over relevant angular scales and redshift ranges.},

@article{Feng16,
	Abstract = {We introduce FastPM, a highly-scalable approximated particle mesh N-body solver, which implements the particle mesh (PM) scheme enforcing correct linear evolution via a cheap low resolution broadband correction at each time step. Employing a 2-dimensional domain decomposing scheme, FastPM scales extremely well with a very large number of CPUs. In contrast to COmoving-LAgrangian (COLA) approach, we do not require to split the force or track separately the 2LPT solution, reducing the code complexity and memory requirements. We compare FastPM with different number of steps ($N_s$) and force resolution factor ($B$) against 3 benchmarks: halo mass function from Friends of Friends halo finder, halo and dark matter power spectrum, and cross correlation coefficient (or stochasticity), relative to a high resolution TreePM simulation. We show that the broadband correction scheme reduces the halo stochasticity when compared to COLA with the same number of steps and force resolution. While increasing $N_s$ and $B$ improves the transfer function and cross correlation coefficient, for many applications FastPM achieves sufficient accuracy at low $N_s$ and $B$. For example, $N_s=10$ and $B=2$ simulation provides a factor of 10 saving of computing time relative to $N_s=40$, $B=3$ simulation, yet the halo benchmarks are very similar at $z=0$. For abundance matched halos the stochasticity remains low even for $N_s=5$. FastPM compares well against less expensive schemes, being only 7 (4) times more expensive than 2LPT initial condition generator for $N_s=10$ ($N_s=5$). Some of the applications where FastPM can be useful are generating a large number of mocks, producing non-linear statistics where one varies a large number of nuisance or cosmological parameters, or serving as part of an initial conditions solver.},

@article{Kiessling11b,
	Abstract = {Fisher Information Matrix methods are commonly used in cosmology to estimate the accuracy that cosmological parameters can be measured with a given experiment and to optimize the design of experiments. However, the standard approach usually assumes both data and parameter estimates are Gaussian-distributed. Further, for survey forecasts and optimization it is usually assumed that the power-spectrum covariance matrix is diagonal in Fourier space. However, in the low-redshift Universe, non-linear mode coupling will tend to correlate small-scale power, moving information from lower to higher order moments of the field. This movement of information will change the predictions of cosmological parameter accuracy. In this paper we quantify this loss of information by comparing na{\"\i}ve Gaussian Fisher matrix forecasts with a maximum likelihood parameter estimation analysis of a suite of mock weak lensing catalogues derived from N-body simulations, based on the SUNGLASS pipeline, for a 2D and tomographic shear analysis of a Euclid-like survey. In both cases, we find that the 68 per cent confidence area of the Omegam-sigma8 plane increases by a factor of 5. However, the marginal errors increase by just 20-40 per cent. We propose a new method to model the effects of non-linear shear-power mode coupling in the Fisher matrix by approximating the shear-power distribution as a multivariate Gaussian with a covariance matrix derived from the mock weak lensing survey. We find that this approximation can reproduce the 68 per cent confidence regions of the full maximum likelihood analysis in the Omegam-sigma8 plane to high accuracy for both 2D and tomographic weak lensing surveys. Finally, we perform a multiparameter analysis of Omegam, sigma8, h, ns, w0 and wa to compare the Gaussian and non-linear mode-coupled Fisher matrix contours. The 6D volume of the 1sigma error contours for the non-linear Fisher analysis is a factor of 3 larger than for the Gaussian case, and the shape of the 68 per cent confidence volume is modified. We propose that future Fisher matrix estimates of cosmological parameter accuracies should include mode-coupling effects.},

	Abstract = {Using 1000 ray-tracing simulations for a Lambda-dominated cold dark model in Sato et al., we study the covariance matrix of cosmic shear correlation functions, which is the standard statistics used in previous measurements. The shear correlation function of a particular separation angle is affected by Fourier modes over a wide range of multipoles, even beyond a survey area, which complicates the analysis of the covariance matrix. To overcome such obstacles we first construct Gaussian shear simulations from the 1000 realizations and then use the Gaussian simulations to disentangle the Gaussian covariance contribution to the covariance matrix we measured from the original simulations. We found that an analytical formula of Gaussian covariance overestimates the covariance amplitudes due to an effect of the finite survey area. Furthermore, the clean separation of the Gaussian covariance allows us to examine the non-Gaussian covariance contributions as a function of separation angles and source redshifts. For upcoming surveys with typical source redshifts of zs = 0.6 and 1.0, the non-Gaussian contribution to the diagonal covariance components at 1 arcmin scales is greater than the Gaussian contribution by a factor of 20 and 10, respectively. Predictions based on the halo model qualitatively well reproduce the simulation results, however show a sizable disagreement in the covariance amplitudes. By combining these simulation results we develop a fitting formula to the covariance matrix for a survey with arbitrary area coverage, taking into account effects of the finiteness of survey area on the Gaussian covariance.},

	Abstract = {Context. Weak gravitational lensing is one of the most promising tools to investigate the equation-of-state of dark energy. In order to obtain reliable parameter estimations for current and future experiments, a good theoretical understanding of dark matter clustering is essential. Of particular interest is the statistical precision to which weak lensing observables, such as cosmic shear correlation functions, can be determined.  Aims: We construct a fitting formula for the non-Gaussian part of the covariance of the lensing power spectrum. The Gaussian contribution to the covariance, which is proportional to the lensing power spectrum squared, and optionally shape noise can be included easily by adding their contributions.  Methods: Starting from a canonical estimator for the dimensionless lensing power spectrum, we model first the covariance in the halo model approach including all four halo terms for one fiducial cosmology and then fit two polynomials to the expression found. On large scales, we use a first-order polynomial in the wave-numbers and dimensionless power spectra that goes asymptotically towards 1.1 C_pt for l --> 0, i.e., the result for the non-Gaussian part of the covariance using tree-level perturbation theory. On the other hand, for small scales we employ a second-order polynomial in the dimensionless power spectra for the fit.  Results: We obtain a fitting formula for the non-Gaussian contribution of the convergence power spectrum covariance that is accurate to 10% for the off-diagonal elements, and to 5% for the diagonal elements, in the range 50 ⪅ l ⪅ 5000 nd can be used for single source redshifts zs ∈ [0.5,2.0] in WMAP5-like cosmologies.},

@article{Eifler09,
	Abstract = {Context: In cosmic shear likelihood analyses, the covariance is most commonly assumed to be constant in parameter space. Therefore, when calculating the covariance matrix (analytically or from simulations), its underlying cosmology should not influence the likelihood contours. Aims: We examine whether the aforementioned assumptions hold and quantify how strong cosmic shear covariances vary within a reasonable parameter range. Furthermore, we examine the impact on likelihood contours when assuming different cosmologies in the covariance. The final goal is to develop an improved likelihood analysis for parameter estimation with cosmic shear.  Methods: We calculate Gaussian covariances analytically for 2500 different cosmologies. To quantify the impact on the parameter constraints, we perform a likelihood analysis for each covariance matrix and compare the likelihood contours. To improve on the assumption of a constant covariance, we use an adaptive covariance matrix, which is continuously updated according to the point in parameter space where the likelihood is evaluated. As a side-effect, this cosmology-dependent covariance improves the parameter constraints. We examine this more closely using the Fisher-matrix formalism. In addition, we quantify the impact of non-Gaussian covariances on the likelihood contours using a ray-tracing covariance derived from the Millennium simulation. In this ansatz, we return to the approximation of a cosmology-independent covariance matrix, and to minimize the error due to this approximation, we develop the concept of an iterative likelihood analysis.  Results: Covariances vary significantly within the considered parameter range. The cosmology assumed in the covariance has a non-negligible impact on the size of the likelihood contours. This impact increases with increasing survey size, increasing number density of source galaxies, decreasing ellipticity noise, and when taking non-Gaussianity into account. A proper treatment of this effect is therefore even more important for future surveys. In this paper, we present methods for taking cosmology-dependent covariances into account.},

@article{Neyrinck06,
	Abstract = {Using the halo model, we investigate the cosmological Fisher information in the non-linear dark-matter power spectrum about the initial amplitude of linear power. We find that there is little information on `translinear' scales (where the one- and two-halo terms are both significant) beyond what is on linear scales, but that additional information is present on small scales, where the one-halo term dominates. This behaviour agrees with the surprising results that Rimes & Hamilton found using N-body simulations. We argue that the translinear plateau in cumulative information arises largely from fluctuations in the numbers of large haloes in a finite volume. This implies that more information could be extracted on non-linear scales if the masses of the largest haloes in a survey are known.},

@article{Scoccimarro99,
	Abstract = {Gravitational clustering is an intrinsically nonlinear process that generates significant non-Gaussian signatures in the density field. We consider how these affect power spectrum determinations from galaxy and weak-lensing surveys. Non-Gaussian effects not only increase the individual error bars compared to the Gaussian case but, most importantly, lead to nontrivial cross-correlations between different band powers, correlating small-scale band powers both among themselves and with those at large scales. We calculate the power-spectrum covariance matrix in nonlinear perturbation theory (weakly nonlinear regime), in the hierarchical model (strongly nonlinear regime), and from numerical simulations in real and redshift space. In particular, we show that the hierarchical Ansatz cannot be strictly valid for the configurations of the trispectrum involved in the calculation of the power-spectrum covariance matrix. We discuss the impact of these results on parameter estimation from power-spectrum measurements and their dependence on the size of the survey and the choice of band powers. We show that the non-Gaussian terms in the covariance matrix become dominant for scales smaller than the nonlinear scale knl~0.2 h-1 Mpc-1, depending somewhat on power normalization. Furthermore, we find that cross-correlations mostly deteriorate the determination of the amplitude of a rescaled power spectrum, whereas its shape is less affected. In weak lensing surveys the projection tends to reduce the importance of non-Gaussian effects. Even so, for background galaxies at redshift z~1, the non-Gaussian contribution rises significantly around l~1000 and could become comparable to the Gaussian terms depending upon the power spectrum normalization and cosmology. The projection has another interesting effect: the ratio between non-Gaussian and Gaussian contributions saturates and can even decrease at small enough angular scales if the power spectrum of the three-dimensional field falls faster than k-2.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the cosmological Fisher information in the non-linear dark matter power spectrum in the context of the halo model. We find that there is a plateau in information content on translinear scales which is generic to all cosmological parameters we tried. There is a rise in information on smaller scales, but we find that it is quite degenerate among different cosmological parameters (except, perhaps, the tilt). This suggests that it could be difficult to constrain cosmological parameters using the non-linear regime of the dark-matter power spectrum. We suggest ways to get around this problem, such as removing the largest haloes from consideration in survey analysis.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the photometric redshift catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5 (SDSS DR5) to estimate the Fisher information in the galaxy angular power spectrum with the help of the Rimes-Hamilton technique. It is found that the amount of Fisher information contained in the galaxy angular power spectrum is saturated at lensing multipole scale 300 <= l<= 2000 in the redshift range 0.1 <= photo-z < 0.5. At l = 2000, the observed information is 2 orders of magnitude lower than the case of Gaussian fluctuations. This supports observationally that the translinear regime of the density power spectrum contains little independent information about the initial cosmological conditions, which is consistent with the numerical trend shown by Rimes-Hamilton. Our results also suggest that the Gaussian-noise description may not be valid in weak-lensing measurements.},

	Abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing observations probe the spectrum and evolution of density fluctuations and the cosmological parameters that govern them. At low redshifts, the nonlinear gravitational evolution of large-scale structure produces a non-Gaussian covariance in the shear power spectrum measurements that affects their translation into cosmological parameters. Using the dark matter halo approach, we study the covariance of binned band power spectrum estimates and the four-point function of the dark matter density field that underlies it. We compare this semianalytic estimate to results from N-body numerical simulations and find good agreement. We find that for a survey out to z~1, the power spectrum covariance increases the errors on cosmological parameters determined under the Gaussian assumption by about 15%.},

@article{Takada09,
	Abstract = {The weak lensing power spectrum carries cosmological information via its dependence on the growth of structure and on geometric factors. Since much of the cosmological information comes from scales affected by non-linear clustering, measurements of the lensing power spectrum can be degraded by non-Gaussian covariances. Recently, there have been conflicting studies about the level of this degradation. We use the halo model to estimate it and include new contributions related to the finite size of lensing surveys, following Rimes and Hamilton's study of three-dimensional simulations. We find that non-Gaussian correlations between different multipoles can degrade the cumulative signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for the power spectrum amplitude by up to a factor of 2 (or 5 for a worst-case model that exceeds current N-body simulation predictions). However, using an eight-parameter Fisher analysis, we find that the marginalized errors on individual parameters are degraded by less than 10 per cent (or 20 per cent for the worst-case model). The smaller degradation in parameter accuracy is primarily because: individual parameters in a high-dimensional parameter space are degraded much less than the volume of the full Fisher ellipsoid; lensing involves projections along the line of sight, which reduce the non-Gaussian effect; some of the cosmological information comes from geometric factors which are not degraded at all. We contrast our findings with those of Lee and Pen who suggested a much larger degradation in information content. Finally, our results give a useful guide for exploring survey design by giving the cosmological information returns for varying survey area, depth and the level of some systematic errors.},

@article{Friedrich16,
	Abstract = {Data re-sampling methods such as delete-one jackknife, bootstrap or the sub-sample covariance are common tools for estimating the covariance of large-scale structure probes. We investigate different implementations of these methods in the context of cosmic shear two-point statistics. Using lognormal simulations of the convergence field and the corresponding shear field we generate mock catalogues of a known and realistic covariance. For a survey of {˜ } 5000 $\,^{\circ}$ ^2 we find that jackknife, if implemented by deleting sub-volumes of galaxies, provides the most reliable covariance estimates. Bootstrap, in the common implementation of drawing sub-volumes of galaxies, strongly overestimates the statistical uncertainties. In a forecast for the complete 5-yr Dark Energy Survey, we show that internally estimated covariance matrices can provide a large fraction of the true uncertainties on cosmological parameters in a 2D cosmic shear analysis. The volume inside contours of constant likelihood in the Omegam-sigma8 plane as measured with internally estimated covariance matrices is on average ≳85 per cent of the volume derived from the true covariance matrix. The uncertainty on the parameter combination Sigma _8 ˜ sigma _8 Omega _m^{0.5} derived from internally estimated covariances is ˜90 per cent of the true uncertainty.},

	Abstract = {We develop a general method for power-spectrum analysis of three-dimensional redshift surveys. We present rigorous analytical estimates for the statistical uncertainty in the power, and we are able to derive a rigorous optimal weighting scheme under the reasonable (and largely empirically verified) assumption that the long-wavelength Fourier components are Gaussian-distributed. We apply the formalism to the updated one-in-six Queen Mary College, Durham, Oxford, and Toronto (QDOT) IRAS redshift survey and compare our results with data from other probes: APM angular correlations and the CfA and the Berkeley 1.2 Jy IRAS redshift surveys. Our results bear out and further quantify the impression from, e.g., counts-in-cells analysis that there is extra power on large scales as compared to the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model with (Omega h) approx. = 0.5. We apply likelihood analysis using the CDM spectrum with (Omega h) as a free parameter as a phenomenological family of models; we find the best-fitting parameters in redshift space and transform the results to real space. Finally, we calculate the distribution of the estimated long-wavelength power. This agrees remarkably well with the exponential distribution expected for Gaussian fluctuations, even out to powers of 10 times the mean. Our results thus reveal no trace of periodicity or other non-Gaussian behavior.},

By breaking parameter degeneracies of the Planck cosmic microwave background satellite, the Sloan digital sky survey may be able to reduce the Planck error bars by about an order of magnitude on the large-scale power normalization and the reionization optical depth, down to percent levels. However, pinpointing attainable accuracies to within better than a factor of a few depends crucially on whether it will be possible to extract useful information from the mildly nonlinear regime.},

	Abstract = {We apply a method recently introduced to the statistical literature to directly estimate the precision matrix from an ensemble of samples drawn from a corresponding Gaussian distribution. Motivated by the observation that cosmological precision matrices are often approximately sparse, the method allows one to exploit this sparsity of the precision matrix to more quickly converge to an asymptotic 1/sqrt(Nsim) rate while simultaneously providing an error model for all of the terms. Such an estimate can be used as the starting point for further regularization efforts which can improve upon the 1/sqrt(Nsim) limit above, and incorporating such additional steps is straightforward within this framework. We demonstrate the technique with toy models and with an example motivated by large-scale structure two-point analysis, showing significant improvements in the rate of convergence.For the large-scale structure example we find errors on the precision matrix which are factors of 5 smaller than for the sample precision matrix for thousands of simulations or, alternatively, convergence to the same error level with more than an order of magnitude fewer simulations.},

@article{Pearson16,
	Abstract = {The covariance matrices of power-spectrum (P(k)) measurements from galaxy surveys are difficult to compute theoretically. The current best practice is to estimate covariance matrices by computing a sample covariance of a large number of mock catalogues. The next generation of galaxy surveys will require thousands of large volume mocks to determine the covariance matrices to desired accuracy. The errors in the inverse covariance matrix are larger and scale with the number of P(k) bins, making the problem even more acute. We develop a method of estimating covariance matrices using a theoretically justified, few-parameter model, calibrated with mock catalogues. Using a set of 600 BOSS DR11 mock catalogues, we show that a seven parameter model is sufficient to fit the covariance matrix of BOSS DR11 P(k) measurements. The covariance computed with this method is better than the sample covariance at any number of mocks and only ˜100 mocks are required for it to fully converge and the inverse covariance matrix converges at the same rate. This method should work equally well for the next generation of galaxy surveys, although a demand for higher accuracy may require adding extra parameters to the fitting function.},

@article{Izard15arxiv,
	Abstract = {Next generation galaxy surveys demand the development of massive ensembles of galaxy mocks to model the observables and their covariances, what is computationally prohibitive using $N$-body simulations. COLA is a novel method designed to make this feasible by following an approximate dynamics but with up to 3 orders of magnitude speed-ups when compared to an exact $N$-body. In this paper we investigate the optimization of the code parameters in the compromise between computational cost and recovered accuracy in observables such as two-point clustering and halo abundance. We benchmark those observables with a state-of-the-art $N$-body run, the MICE Grand Challenge simulation (MICE-GC). We find that using 40 time steps linearly spaced since $z_i \sim 20$, and a force mesh resolution three times finer than that of the number of particles, yields a matter power spectrum within $1\%$ for $k \lesssim 1\,h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and a halo mass function within $5\%$ of those in the $N$-body. In turn the halo bias is accurate within $2\%$ for $k \lesssim 0.7\,h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ whereas, in redshift space, the halo monopole and quadrupole are within $4\%$ for $k \lesssim 0.4\,h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. These results hold for a broad range in redshift ($0 < z < 1$) and for all halo mass bins investigated ($M > 10^{12.5} \, h^{-1} \, {\rm M_{\odot}}$). To bring accuracy in clustering to one percent level we study various methods that re-calibrate halo masses and/or velocities. We thus propose an optimized choice of COLA code parameters as a powerful tool to optimally exploit future galaxy surveys.},

	Abstract = {When inferring parameters from a Gaussian-distributed data set by computing a likelihood, a covariance matrix is needed that describes the data errors and their correlations. If the covariance matrix is not known a priori, it may be estimated and thereby becomes a random object with some intrinsic uncertainty itself. We show how to infer parameters in the presence of such an estimated covariance matrix, by marginalizing over the true covariance matrix, conditioned on its estimated value. This leads to a likelihood function that is no longer Gaussian, but rather an adapted version of a multivariate t-distribution, which has the same numerical complexity as the multivariate Gaussian. As expected, marginalization over the true covariance matrix improves inference when compared with Hartlap et al.'s method, which uses an unbiased estimate of the inverse covariance matrix but still assumes that the likelihood is Gaussian.},

@article{Grieb16,
	Abstract = {Measurements of the redshift-space galaxy clustering have been a prolific source of cosmological information in recent years. Accurate covariance estimates are an essential step for the validation of galaxy clustering models of the redshift-space two-point statistics. Usually, only a limited set of accurate N-body simulations is available. Thus, assessing the data covariance is not possible or only leads to a noisy estimate. Further, relying on simulated realizations of the survey data means that tests of the cosmology dependence of the covariance are expensive. With these points in mind, this work presents a simple theoretical model for the linear covariance of anisotropic galaxy clustering observations with synthetic catalogues. Considering the Legendre moments (`multipoles') of the two-point statistics and projections into wide bins of the line-of-sight parameter (`clustering wedges'), we describe the modelling of the covariance for these anisotropic clustering measurements for galaxy samples with a trivial geometry in the case of a Gaussian approximation of the clustering likelihood. As main result of this paper, we give the explicit formulae for Fourier and configuration space covariance matrices. To validate our model, we create synthetic halo occupation distribution galaxy catalogues by populating the haloes of an ensemble of large-volume N-body simulations. Using linear and non-linear input power spectra, we find very good agreement between the model predictions and the measurements on the synthetic catalogues in the quasi-linear regime.},

	Abstract = {The covariance matrix of the matter power spectrum is a key element of the statistical analysis of galaxy clustering data. Independent realisations of observational measurements can be used to sample the covariance, nevertheless statistical sampling errors will propagate into the cosmological parameter inference potentially limiting the capabilities of the upcoming generation of galaxy surveys. The impact of these errors as function of the number of independent realisations has been previously evaluated for Gaussian distributed data. However, non-linearities in the late time clustering of matter cause departures from Gaussian statistics. Here, we address the impact of non-Gaussian errors on the sample covariance and precision matrix errors using a large ensemble of numerical N-body simulations. In the range of modes where finite volume effects are negligible ($0.1\lesssim k\,[h\,{\rm Mpc^{-1}}]\lesssim 1.2$) we find deviations of the estimated variance of the sample covariance with respect to Gaussian predictions above $\sim 10\%$ level. These reduce to about $\sim 5\%$ in the case of the precision matrix. Finally, we perform a Fisher analysis to estimate the effect of covariance errors on the cosmological parameter constraints. In particular, assuming Euclid-like survey characteristics we find that a number of independent realisation larger than $\gtrsim 5000$ is necessary to reduce the contribution of sample covariance errors to the cosmological parameter uncertainties at sub-percent level. We also show that restricting the analysis to large scales $k\lesssim0.2\,h\,{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ results in a considerable loss in constraining power, while using the linear covariance to include smaller scales leads to an underestimation of the errors on the cosmological parameters.},

	Abstract = {Using multiple tracers of large-scale structure allows to evade the limitations imposed by sampling variance for some parameters of interest in cosmology. We demonstrate the optimal way of carrying out a multitracer analysis in a galaxy redshift survey by considering the principal components of the shot noise matrix from two-point clustering statistics. We show how to construct two tracers that maximize the benefits of sampling variance and shot noise cancellation using optimal weights. On the basis of high-resolution N-body simulations of dark matter halos we apply this technique to the analysis of redshift-space distortions and demonstrate how constraints on the growth rate of structure formation can be substantially improved. The primary limitations are nonlinear effects, which cause significant biases in the method already at scales of k<0.1hMpc-1, suggesting the need to develop nonlinear models of redshift-space distortions in order to extract the maximum information from future redshift surveys. Nonetheless we find gains of a factor of a few in constraints on the growth rate achievable when merely the linear regime of a galaxy survey like EUCLID is considered.},

@article{Cai11,
	Abstract = {We derive the weight function w(M) to apply to dark-matter haloes that minimizes the stochasticity between the weighted halo distribution and its underlying mass density field. The optimal w(M) depends on the range of masses being used in the estimator. While the standard biased-Poisson model of the halo distribution predicts that bias weighting is optimal, the simple fact that the mass is comprised of haloes implies that the optimal w(M) will be a mixture of mass-weighting and bias-weighting. In N-body simulations, the Poisson estimator is up to 15× noisier than the optimal. Implementation of the optimal weight yields significantly lower stochasticity than weighting haloes by their mass, bias or equal weighting in most circumstances. Optimal weighting could make cosmological tests based on the matter power spectrum or cross-correlations much more powerful and/or cost effective. A volume-limited measurement of the mass power spectrum at k= 0.2 h Mpc-1 over the entire z < 1 universe could ideally be done using only 6 million redshifts of haloes with mass M > 6 × 1013 h-1 M&sun; (1 × 1013) at z= 0 (z= 1); this is 5× fewer than what the Poisson model predicts. Using halo occupancy distributions (HODs) we find that uniformly weighted catalogues of luminous red galaxies require >=3× more redshifts than an optimally weighted halo catalogue to reconstruct the mass to the same accuracy. While the mean HODs of galaxies chosen to lie above a threshold luminosity are fortuitously very similar to the optimal w(M), the stochasticity of the halo occupation degrades the mass estimator. Blue or emission-line galaxies are ≈100× less efficient at reconstructing mass than an optimal weighting scheme. This suggests an efficient observational approach of identifying and weighting haloes with a deep photo-z survey before conducting a spectroscopic survey. The optimal w(M) and mass-estimator stochasticity predicted by the standard halo model for M > 1012 h-1 M&sun; are in reasonable agreement with our measurements, with the important exceptions that the haloes must be assumed to be linearly biased samples of a `halo field' that is distinct from the mass field. Halo catalogues extending below 1012 h-1 M&sun; are more stochastic than the halo model predicts, suggesting that halo exclusion or other effects violate the assumption that haloes sample this halo field via a Poisson process.},

@article{Jennings15,
	Abstract = {The non-linear, scale-dependent bias in the mass distribution of galaxies and the underlying dark matter is a key systematic affecting the extraction of cosmological parameters from galaxy clustering. Using 95 million haloes from the Millennium-XXL N-body simulation, we find that the mass bias is scale independent only for k < 0.1 h Mpc-1 today (z = 0) and for k < 0.2 h Mpc-1 at z = 0.7. We test analytic halo bias models against our simulation measurements and find that the model of Tinker et al. is accurate to better than 5 per cent at z = 0. However, the simulation results are better fitted by an ellipsoidal collapse model at z = 0.7. We highlight, for the first time, another potentially serious systematic due to a sampling bias in the halo velocity divergence power spectra which will affect the comparison between observations and any redshift-space distortion model which assumes dark matter velocity statistics with no velocity bias. By measuring the velocity divergence power spectra for different sized halo samples, we find that there is a significant bias which increases with decreasing number density. This bias is approximately 20 per cent at k = 0.1 h Mpc-1 for a halo sample of number density bar{n} = 10^{-3} (h/ Mpc)3 at both z = 0 and 0.7 for the velocity divergence auto power spectrum. Given the importance of redshift-space distortions as a probe of dark energy and the major ongoing effort to advance models for the clustering signal in redshift space, our results show that this velocity bias introduces another systematic, alongside scale-dependent halo mass bias, which cannot be neglected.},

@article{Gil-Marin10,
	Abstract = {Comparing clustering of differently biased tracers of the dark matter distribution offers the opportunity to reduce the sample or cosmic variance error in the measurement of certain cosmological parameters. We develop a formalism that includes bias non-linearities and stochasticity. Our formalism is general enough that it can be used to optimize survey design and tracers selection and optimally split (or combine) tracers to minimize the error on the cosmologically interesting quantities. Our approach generalizes the one presented by McDonald & Seljak of circumventing sample variance in the measurement of f ≡ d lnD/d lna. We analyse how the bias, the noise, the non-linearity and stochasticity affect the measurements of Df and explore in which signal-to-noise regime it is significantly advantageous to split a galaxy sample in two differently biased tracers. We use N-body simulations to find realistic values for the parameters describing the bias properties of dark matter haloes of different masses and their number density. We find that, even if dark matter haloes could be used as tracers and selected in an idealized way, for realistic haloes, the sample variance limit can be reduced only by up to a factor sigma2tr/sigma1tr ~= 0.6. This would still correspond to the gain from a three times larger survey volume if the two tracers were not to be split. Before any practical application one should bear in mind that these findings apply to dark matter haloes as tracers, while realistic surveys would select galaxies: the galaxy-host halo relation is likely to introduce extra stochasticity, which may reduce the gain further.},

	Abstract = {On large scales, galaxies and their haloes are usually assumed to trace the dark matter with a constant bias and dark matter is assumed to trace the linear density field. We test these assumption using several large N-body simulations with 3843-10243 particles and box sizes of 96-1152h-1Mpc, which can both resolve the small galactic-size haloes and sample the large-scale fluctuations. We explore the average halo bias relation as a function of halo mass and show that existing fitting formulae overestimate the halo bias by up to 20 per cent in the regime just below the non-linear mass. We propose a new expression that fits our simulations well. We find that the halo bias is nearly constant, b~ 0.65-0.7, for masses below one-tenth of the non-linear mass. We next explore the relation between the initial and final dark matter in individual Fourier modes and show that there are significant fluctuations in their ratio, ranging from 10 per cent rms at k~ 0.03hMpc-1 to 50 per cent rms at k~ 0.1hMpc-1. We argue that these large fluctuations are caused by perturbative effects beyond the linear theory, which are dominated by long-wavelength modes with large random fluctuations. Similar or larger fluctuations exist between haloes and dark matter and between haloes of different mass. These fluctuations must be included in attempts to determine the relative bias of two populations from their maps, which would otherwise be immune to sampling variance.},

@article{Hamaus10,
	Abstract = {In recent work (Seljak, Hamaus, and Desjacques 2009) it was found that weighting central halo galaxies by halo mass can significantly suppress their stochasticity relative to the dark matter, well below the Poisson model expectation. This is useful for constraining relations between galaxies and the dark matter, such as the galaxy bias, especially in situations where sampling variance errors can be eliminated. In this paper we extend this study with the goal of finding the optimal mass-dependent halo weighting. We use N-body simulations to perform a general analysis of halo stochasticity and its dependence on halo mass. We investigate the stochasticity matrix, defined as Cij≡<(deltai-bideltam)(deltaj-bjdeltam)>, where deltam is the dark matter overdensity in Fourier space, deltai the halo overdensity of the i-th halo mass bin, and bi the corresponding halo bias. In contrast to the Poisson model predictions we detect nonvanishing correlations between different mass bins. We also find the diagonal terms to be sub-Poissonian for the highest-mass halos. The diagonalization of this matrix results in one large and one low eigenvalue, with the remaining eigenvalues close to the Poisson prediction 1/n¯, where n¯ is the mean halo number density. The eigenmode with the lowest eigenvalue contains most of the information and the corresponding eigenvector provides an optimal weighting function to minimize the stochasticity between halos and dark matter. We find this optimal weighting function to match linear mass weighting at high masses, while at the low-mass end the weights approach a constant whose value depends on the low-mass cut in the halo mass function. This weighting further suppresses the stochasticity as compared to the previously explored mass weighting. Finally, we employ the halo model to derive the stochasticity matrix and the scale-dependent bias from an analytical perspective. It is remarkably successful in reproducing our numerical results and predicts that the stochasticity between halos and the dark matter can be reduced further when going to halo masses lower than we can resolve in current simulations.},

@article{zhengyi15b,
	Abstract = {A profound assumption in peculiar velocity cosmology is bv=1 at sufficiently large scales, where bv is the volume-weighted halo(galaxy) velocity bias with respect to the matter velocity field. However, this fundamental assumption has not been robustly verified in numerical simulations. Furthermore, it is challenged by structure formation theory (Bardeen, Bond, Kaiser and Szalay, Astrophys. J. 304, 15 (1986); Desjacques and Sheth, Phys. Rev D 81, 023526 (2010), which predicts the existence of velocity bias (at least for proto-halos) due to the fact that halos reside in special regions (local density peaks). The major obstacle to measuring the volume-weighted velocity from N-body simulations is an unphysical sampling artifact. It is entangled in the measured velocity statistics and becomes significant for sparse populations. With recently improved understanding of the sampling artifact (Zhang, Zheng and Jing, 2015, PRD; Zheng, Zhang and Jing, 2015, PRD), for the first time we are able to appropriately correct this sampling artifact and then robustly measure the volume-weighted halo velocity bias. (1) We verify bv=1 within 2% model uncertainty at k ≲0.1 h /Mpc and z =0 - 2 for halos of mass ˜1012- 1013h-1M&sun; and, therefore, consolidate a foundation for the peculiar velocity cosmology. (2) We also find statistically significant signs of bv!=1 at k ≳0.1 h /Mpc . Unfortunately, whether this is real or caused by a residual sampling artifact requires further investigation. Nevertheless, cosmology based on the k ≳0.1 h /Mpc velocity data should be careful with this potential velocity bias.},

@article{Inman15,
	Abstract = {Discovering the mass of neutrinos is a principle goal in high energy physics and cosmology. In addition to cosmological measurements based on two-point statistics, the neutrino mass can also be estimated by observations of neutrino wakes resulting from the relative motion between cold dark matter (CDM) and neutrinos. Such a detection relies on an accurate reconstruction of the CDM-neutrino relative velocity which is affected by nonlinear structure growth and galaxy bias. We investigate our ability to reconstruct this relative velocity using large N -body simulations where we evolve neutrinos as distinct particles alongside the CDM. We find that the CDM velocity power spectrum is overpredicted by linear theory whereas the neutrino velocity power spectrum is underpredicted. The magnitude of the relative velocity observed in the simulations is found to be lower than what is predicted in linear theory. Since neither the CDM nor the neutrino velocity fields are directly observable from galaxy or 21 cm surveys, we test the accuracy of a reconstruction algorithm based on halo density fields and linear theory. Assuming prior knowledge of the halo bias, we find that the reconstructed relative velocities are highly correlated with the simulated ones with correlation coefficients of 0.94, 0.93, 0.92 and 0.88 for neutrinos of mass 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 eV. We confirm that the relative velocity field reconstructed from large scale structure observations such as galaxy or 21 cm surveys can be accurate in direction and, with appropriate scaling, magnitude.},

@article{Kitaura13b,
	Abstract = {We present a new fast and efficient approach to model structure formation with augmented Lagrangian perturbation theory (ALPT). Our method is based on splitting the displacement field into a long- and a short-range component. The long-range component is computed by second-order LPT (2LPT). This approximation contains a tidal non-local and non-linear term. Unfortunately, 2LPT fails on small scales due to severe shell crossing and a crude quadratic behaviour in the low-density regime. The spherical collapse (SC) approximation has been recently reported to correct for both effects by adding an ideal collapse truncation. However, this approach fails to reproduce the structures on large scales where it is significantly less correlated with the N-body result than 2LPT or linear LPT (the Zel'dovich approximation). We propose to combine both approximations using for the short-range displacement field the SC solution. A Gaussian filter with a smoothing radius rS is used to separate between both regimes. We use the result of 25 dark-matter-only N-body simulations to benchmark at z = 0 the different approximations: first-, second-, third-order LPT, SC and our novel combined ALPT model. This comparison demonstrates that our method improves previous approximations at all scales showing ˜25 and ˜75 per cent higher correlation than 2LPT with the N-body solution at k = 1 and 2 h Mpc-1, respectively. We conduct a parameter study to determine the optimal range of smoothing radii and find that the maximum correlation is achieved with rS = 4-5 h-1 Mpc. This structure formation approach could be used for various purposes, such as setting-up initial conditions for N-body simulations, generating mock galaxy catalogues, cosmic web analysis or for reconstructions of the primordial density fluctuations.},

	Abstract = {Robust measurements based on current large-scale structure surveys require precise knowledge of statistical and systematic errors. This can be obtained from large numbers of realistic mock galaxy catalogues that mimic the observed distribution of galaxies within the survey volume. To this end we present a fast, distributed-memory, planar-parallel code, L-PICOLA, which can be used to generate and evolve a set of initial conditions into a dark matter field much faster than a full non-linear N-Body simulation. Additionally, L-PICOLA has the ability to include primordial non-Gaussianity in the simulation and simulate the past lightcone at run-time, with optional replication of the simulation volume. Through comparisons to fully non-linear N-Body simulations we find that our code can reproduce the z = 0 power spectrum and reduced bispectrum of dark matter to within 2% and 5% respectively on all scales of interest to measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Redshift Space Distortions, but 3 orders of magnitude faster. The accuracy, speed and scalability of this code, alongside the additional features we have implemented, make it extremely useful for both current and next generation large-scale structure surveys. L-PICOLA is publicly available at <ce:inter-ref},

	Abstract = {We present a new methodology to generate mock halo or galaxy catalogues, which have accurate clustering properties, nearly indistinguishable from full N-body solutions, in terms of the one-point, two-point, and three-point statistics. In particular, the agreement is remarkable, within 1 per cent up to k = 0.55 h Mpc-1 and down to r = 10 h-1 Mpc, for the power spectrum and two-point correlation function, respectively, while the bispectrum agrees in general within 20 per cent for different scales and shapes. Our approach is based on the Zel'dovich approximation, however, effectively including with the simple prescriptions the missing physical ingredients, and stochastic scale-dependent, non-local, and non-linear biasing contributions. The computing time and memory required to produce one mock is similar to that using the lognormal model. With high accuracy and efficiency, the effective Zel'dovich approximation mocks (EZmocks) provide a reliable and practical method to produce massive mock galaxy catalogues for the analysis of large-scale structure measurements.},

Mock catalogues are used to optimize survey design, test reduction and analysis pipelines, make theoretical predictions for basic observables and propagate errors through complex analysis chains. We present a new method, which we call `quick particle mesh', for generating many large volume, approximate mock catalogues at low computational cost. The method is based on using rapid, low-resolution particle mesh simulations that accurately reproduce the large-scale dark matter density field. Particles are sampled from the density field based on their local density such that they have N-point statistics nearly equivalent to the haloes resolved in high-resolution simulations, creating a set of mock haloes that can be populated using halo occupation methods to create galaxy mocks for a variety of possible target classes.},

	Abstract = {We present sCOLA -- an extension of the N-body COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method to the spatial domain. Similar to the original temporal-domain COLA, sCOLA is an N-body method for solving for large-scale structure in a frame that is comoving with observers following trajectories calculated in Lagrangian Perturbation Theory. Incorporating the sCOLA method in an N-body code allows one to gain computational speed by capturing the gravitational potential from the far field using perturbative techniques, while letting the N-body code solve only for the near field. The far and near fields are completely decoupled, effectively localizing gravity for the N-body side of the code. Thus, running an N-body code for a small simulation volume using sCOLA can reproduce the results of a standard N-body run for the same small volume embedded inside a much larger simulation. We demonstrate that sCOLA can be safely combined with the original temporal-domain COLA. sCOLA can be used as a method for performing zoom-in simulations. It also allows N-body codes to be made embarrassingly parallel, thus allowing for efficiently tiling a volume of interest using grid computing. Moreover, sCOLA can be useful for cheaply generating large ensembles of accurate mock halo catalogs required to study galaxy clustering. Surveys that will benefit the most are ones with large aspect ratios, such as pencil-beam surveys, where sCOLA can easily capture the effects of large-scale transverse modes without the need to substantially increase the simulated volume. As an illustration of the method, we present proof-of-concept zoom-in simulations using a freely available sCOLA-based N-body code.},

	Abstract = {We present a simple method of generating approximate synthetic halo catalogues: HALOGEN. This method uses a combination of second-order Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (2LPT) in order to generate the large-scale matter distribution, analytical mass functions to generate halo masses, and a single-parameter stochastic model for halo bias to position haloes. HALOGEN represents a simplification of similar recently published methods. Our method is constrained to recover the two-point function at intermediate (10 h-1 Mpc < r < 50 h-1 Mpc) scales, which we show is successful to within 2 per cent. Larger scales (˜100 h-1 Mpc) are reproduced to within 15 per cent. We compare several other statistics (e.g. power spectrum, point distribution function, redshift space distortions) with results from N-body simulations to determine the validity of our method for different purposes. One of the benefits of HALOGEN is its flexibility, and we demonstrate this by showing how it can be adapted to varying cosmologies and simulation specifications. A driving motivation for the development of such approximate schemes is the need to compute covariance matrices and study the systematic errors for large galaxy surveys, which requires thousands of simulated realizations. We discuss the applicability of our method in this context, and conclude that it is well suited to mass production of appropriate halo catalogues. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/savila/halogen.},

	Abstract = {We present the COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method: an N-body method for solving for Large Scale Structure (LSS) in a frame that is comoving with observers following trajectories calculated in Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT). Unlike standard N-body methods, the COLA method can straightforwardly trade accuracy at small-scales in order to gain computational speed without sacrificing accuracy at large scales. This is especially useful for cheaply generating large ensembles of accurate mock halo catalogs required to study galaxy clustering and weak lensing, as those catalogs are essential for performing detailed error analysis for ongoing and future surveys of LSS. As an illustration, we ran a COLA-based N-body code on a box of size 100 Mpc/h with particles of mass ≈ 5 × 109Msolar/h. Running the code with only 10 timesteps was sufficient to obtain an accurate description of halo statistics down to halo masses of at least 1011Msolar/h. This is only at a modest speed penalty when compared to mocks obtained with LPT. A standard detailed N-body run is orders of magnitude slower than our COLA-based code. The speed-up we obtain with COLA is due to the fact that we calculate the large-scale dynamics exactly using LPT, while letting the N-body code solve for the small scales, without requiring it to capture exactly the internal dynamics of halos. Achieving a similar level of accuracy in halo statistics without the COLA method requires at least 3 times more timesteps than when COLA is employed.},

	Abstract = {We present an accurate and fast framework for generating mock catalogues including low-mass halos, based on an implementation of the COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) technique. Multiple realisations of mock catalogues are crucial for analyses of large-scale structure, but conventional N-body simulations are too computationally expensive for the production of thousands of realisations. We show that COLA simulations can produce accurate mock catalogues with a moderate computation resource for low- to intermediate- mass galaxies in $10^{12} M_\odot$ haloes, both in real and redshift space. COLA simulations have accurate peculiar velocities, without systematic errors in the velocity power spectra for k < 0.15 h/Mpc, and with only 3-per-cent error for k < 0.2 h/Mpc. We use COLA with 10 time steps and a Halo Occupation Distribution to produce 600 mock galaxy catalogues of the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. Our parallelized code for efficient generation of accurate halo catalogues is publicly available at github.com/junkoda/cola_halo.},

@article{Monaco13,
	Abstract = {We present a new parallel implementation of the PINpointing Orbit Crossing-Collapsed HIerarchical Objects (PINOCCHIO) algorithm, a quick tool, based on Lagrangian Perturbation Theory, for the hierarchical build-up of dark matter (DM) haloes in cosmological volumes. To assess its ability to predict halo correlations on large scales, we compare its results with those of an N-body simulation of a 3 h-1 Gpc box sampled with 20483 particles taken from the MICE suite, matching the same seeds for the initial conditions. Thanks to the Fastest Fourier Transforms in the West (FFTW) libraries and to the relatively simple design, the code shows very good scaling properties. The CPU time required by PINOCCHIO is a tiny fraction (˜1/2000) of that required by the MICE simulation. Varying some of PINOCCHIO numerical parameters allows one to produce a universal mass function that lies in the range allowed by published fits, although it underestimates the MICE mass function of Friends-of-Friends (FoF) haloes in the high-mass tail. We compare the matter-halo and the halo-halo power spectra with those of the MICE simulation and find that these two-point statistics are well recovered on large scales. In particular, when catalogues are matched in number density, agreement within 10 per cent is achieved for the halo power spectrum. At scales k > 0.1 h Mpc-1, the inaccuracy of the Zel'dovich approximation in locating halo positions causes an underestimate of the power spectrum that can be modelled as a Gaussian factor with a damping scale of d = 3 h-1 Mpc at z = 0, decreasing at higher redshift. Finally, a remarkable match is obtained for the reduced halo bispectrum, showing a good description of non-linear halo bias. Our results demonstrate the potential of PINOCCHIO as an accurate and flexible tool for generating large ensembles of mock galaxy surveys, with interesting applications for the analysis of large galaxy redshift surveys.},

@article{Monaco02,
	Abstract = {pinocchio (PINpointing Orbit-Crossing Collapsed HIerarchical Objects) is a new algorithm proposed recently by Monaco et al. (Paper I) for identifying dark matter haloes in a given numerical realization of the linear density field in a hierarchical universe. Mass elements are assumed to have collapsed after undergoing orbit crossing, as computed using perturbation theory. It is shown that Lagrangian perturbation theory, and in particular its ellipsoidal truncation, is able to predict accurately the collapse, in the orbit-crossing sense, of generic mass elements. Collapsed points are grouped into haloes using an algorithm that mimics the hierarchical growth of structure through accretion and mergers. Some points that have undergone orbit crossing are assigned to the network of filaments and sheets that connects the haloes; it is demonstrated that this network resembles closely that found in N -body simulations. The code generates a catalogue of dark matter haloes with known mass, position, velocity, merging history and angular momentum. It is shown that the predictions of the code are very accurate when compared with the results of large N -body simulations that cover a range of cosmological models, box sizes and numerical resolutions. The mass function is recovered with an accuracy of better than 10 per cent in number density for haloes with at least 30-50 particles. A similar accuracy is reached in the estimate of the correlation length r 0 . The good agreement is still valid on the object-by-object level, with 70-100 per cent of the objects with more than 50 particles in the simulations also identified by our algorithm. For these objects the masses are recovered with an error of 20-40 per cent, and positions and velocities with a root mean square error of ~1-2Mpc (0.5-2 grid lengths) and ~100kms-1 , respectively. The recovery of the angular momentum of haloes is considerably noisier, and accuracy at the statistical level is achieved only by introducing free parameters. The algorithm requires negligible computer time as compared with performing a numerical N -body simulation.},

We compare the sample covariance matrix from our mocks with analytic estimates, and discuss differences. We have used this method to make catalogues corresponding to Data Release 9 of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), producing 600 mock catalogues of the `CMASS' galaxy sample.

	Abstract = {Current models of galaxy formation applied to understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe have two parts. The first is an accurate solution of the equations of motion for the dark matter caused by gravitational clustering. The second consists of making physically reasonable approximations to the behaviour of baryons inside dark matter haloes. The first uses large, computationally intensive, N-body simulations. We argue that because the second step is, at least at present, uncertain, it is possible to obtain similar galaxy distributions without solving the first step exactly. We describe an algorithm that is several orders of magnitude faster than N-body simulations, but that is, nevertheless, rather accurate. The algorithm combines perturbation theory with virialized halo models of the non-linear density and velocity fields. For two- and three-point statistics the resulting fields are exact on large scales, and rather accurate well into the non-linear regime, particularly for two-point statistics in real and redshift space. We then show how one can use this algorithm to generate mock galaxy distributions from halo occupation numbers. As a first application, we show that it provides a good description of the clustering of galaxies in the PSCz survey. We also discuss applications to the estimation of non-Gaussian contributions to the error bars and the covariance matrix of the power spectrum, in real and redshift space, for galaxies and dark matter. The results for the latter show good agreement with simulations, supporting the use of our method for constraining cosmological parameters from forthcoming galaxy surveys.},

	Abstract = {We measure the monopole moment of the three-point correlation function on scales 1-70h-1Mpc in the two-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS). Volume-limited samples are constructed using a series of integral magnitude bins between M=-18 to -22. Our measurements with a novel edge-corrected estimator represent most, if not all, three-point level monopole or angular averaged information in the catalogue. We fit a perturbative non-linear bias model to a joint data vector formed from the estimated two- and three-point correlation functions. Two different models are used: an analytic model based on Eulerian perturbation theory including bias and redshift distortions and a phenomenological bias model based on the direct redshift space measurements in the large Virgo simulations. To interpret the clustering results, we perform a three-parameter Gaussian maximum-likelihood analysis. In the canonical -21 to -20 volume-limited sample, we find sigma8= 0.93+0.06-0.2, b= 1.04+0.23-0.09 and b2=-0.06+0.003-0.001. Our estimate of sigma8 is robust across the different volume-limited samples constructed. These results, based solely on the large-scale clustering of galaxies, are in excellent agreement with previous analyses using the Wilkinson Anisotropy Probe; this is a spectacular success of the concordance model. We also present two-parameter fits for the bias parameters, which are in excellent agreement with the previous findings of the bias evolution in the 2dFGRS.},

	Abstract = {We present measurements of weak gravitational lensing cosmic shear two-point statistics using Dark Energy Survey Science Verification data. We demonstrate that our results are robust to the choice of shear measurement pipeline, either ngmix or im3shape, and robust to the choice of two-point statistic, including both real and Fourier-space statistics. Our results pass a suite of null tests including tests for B-mode contamination and direct tests for any dependence of the two-point functions on a set of 16 observing conditions and galaxy properties, such as seeing, airmass, galaxy color, galaxy magnitude, etc. We furthermore use a large suite of simulations to compute the covariance matrix of the cosmic shear measurements and assign statistical significance to our null tests. We find that our covariance matrix is consistent with the halo model prediction, indicating that it has the appropriate level of halo sample variance. We compare the same jackknife procedure applied to the data and the simulations in order to search for additional sources of noise not captured by the simulations. We find no statistically significant extra sources of noise in the data. The overall detection significance with tomography for our highest source density catalog is 9.7sigma. Cosmological constraints from the measurements in this work are presented in a companion paper (DES et al. 2015).},

@article{Kilbinger05,
	Abstract = {We present predictions for cosmological parameter constraints from combined measurements of second- and third-order statistics of cosmic shear. We define the generalized third-order aperture mass statistics < M_ap3 > and show that it contains much more information about the bispectrum of the projected matter density than the skewness of the aperture mass. From theoretical models as well as from LambdaCDM ray-tracing simulations, we calculate < M_ap2 > and < M_ap3 > and their dependence on cosmological parameters. The covariances including shot noise and cosmic variance of Map^2, M_ap3 and their cross-correlation are calculated using ray-tracing simulations. We perform an extensive Fisher matrix analysis, and for various combinations of cosmological parameters, we predict 1-sigma-errors corresponding to measurements from a deep 29 square degree cosmic shear survey. Although the parameter degeneracies can not be lifted completely, the (linear) combination of second- and third-order aperture mass statistics reduces the errors significantly. The strong degeneracy between Omegam and sigma_8, present for all second-order cosmic shear measures, is diminished substantially, whereas less improvement is found for the near-degenerate pair consisting of the shape parameter Gamma and the spectral index n_s. Uncertainties in the source galaxy redshift z0 increase the errors of all other parameters.},

@article{Joachimi08,
	Abstract = {Aims:In recent years cosmic shear, the weak gravitational lensing effect by the large-scale structure of the Universe, has proven to be one of the observational pillars on which the cosmological concordance model is founded. Several cosmic shear statistics have been developed in order to analyze data from surveys. For the covariances of the prevalent second-order measures we present simple and handy formulae, valid under the assumptions of Gaussian density fluctuations and a simple survey geometry. We also formulate these results in the context of shear tomography, i.e. the inclusion of redshift information, and generalize them to arbitrary data field geometries.  Methods: We define estimators for the E- and B-mode projected power spectra and show them to be unbiased in the case of Gaussianity and a simple survey geometry. From the covariance of these estimators we demonstrate how to derive covariances of arbitrary combinations of second-order cosmic shear measures. We then recalculate the power spectrum covariance for general survey geometries and examine the bias thereby introduced on the estimators for exemplary configurations.  Results: Our results for the covariances are considerably simpler than and analytically shown to be equivalent to the real-space approach presented in the first paper of this series. We find good agreement with other numerical evaluations and confirm the general properties of the covariance matrices. The studies of the specific survey configurations suggest that our simplified covariances may be employed for realistic survey geometries to good approximation.},

	Abstract = {Recently, cosmic shear, the weak lensing effect by the inhomogeneous matter distribution in the Universe, has not only been detected by several groups, but the observational results have been used to derive constraints on cosmological parameters. For this purpose, several cosmic shear statistics have been employed. As shown recently, all second-order statistical measures can be expressed in terms of the two-point correlation functions of the shear, which thus represents the basic quantity; also, from a practical point-of-view, the two-point correlation functions are easiest to obtain from observational data which typically have complicated geometry. We derive in this paper expressions for the covariance matrix of the cosmic shear two-point correlation functions which are readily applied to any survey geometry. Furthermore, we consider the more special case of a simple survey geometry which allows us to obtain approximations for the covariance matrix in terms of integrals which are readily evaluated numerically. These results are then used to study the covariance of the aperture mass dispersion which has been employed earlier in quantitative cosmic shear analyses. We show that the aperture mass dispersion, measured at two different angular scales, quickly decorrelates with the ratio of the scales. Inverting the relation between the shear two-point correlation functions and the power spectrum of the underlying projected matter distribution, we construct estimators for the power spectrum and for the band powers, and show that they yields accurate approximations; in particular, the correlation between band powers at different wave numbers is quite weak. The covariance matrix of the shear correlation function is then used to investigate the expected accuracy of cosmological parameter estimates from cosmic shear surveys. Depending on the use of prior information, e.g. from CMB measurements, cosmic shear can yield very accurate determinations of several cosmological parameters, in particular the normalization sigma_8 of the power spectrum of the matter distribution, the matter density parameter {cal O}mega_m, and the shape parameter Gamma .},

	Abstract = {We investigate the bias and error in estimates of the cosmological parameter covariance matrix due to sampling or modelling the data covariance matrix, for likelihood width and peak scatter estimators. We show that these estimators do not coincide unless the data covariance is exactly known. For sampled data covariances with Gaussian-distributed data and parameters, the parameter covariance matrix estimated from the width of the likelihood has a Wishart distribution, from which we derive the mean and covariance. This mean is biased and we propose an unbiased estimator of the parameter covariance matrix. Comparing our analytic results to a numerical Wishart sampler of the data covariance matrix we find excellent agreement. An accurate ansatz for the mean parameter covariance for the peak scatter estimator is found, and we fit its covariance to our numerical analysis. The mean is again biased and we propose an unbiased estimator for the peak parameter covariance. For sampled data covariances, the width estimator is more accurate than the peak scatter estimator. We investigate modelling the data covariance, or equivalently data compression, and show that the peak scatter estimator is less sensitive to biases in the model data covariance matrix than the width estimator, but requires independent realizations of the data to reduce the statistical error. If the model bias on the peak estimator is sufficiently low, this is promising, otherwise the sampled width estimator is preferable.},

	Abstract = {We present improved methodology for including covariance matrices in the error budget of Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) galaxy clustering measurements, revisiting Data Release 9 (DR9) analyses, and describing a method that is used in DR10/11 analyses presented in companion papers. The precise analysis method adopted is becoming increasingly important, due to the precision that BOSS can now reach: even using as many as 600 mock catalogues to estimate covariance of two-point clustering measurements can still lead to an increase in the errors of ˜20 per cent, depending on how the cosmological parameters of interest are measured. In this paper, we extend previous work on this contribution to the error budget, deriving formulae for errors measured by integrating over the likelihood, and to the distribution of recovered best-fitting parameters fitting the simulations also used to estimate the covariance matrix. Both are situations that previous analyses of BOSS have considered. We apply the formulae derived to baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and redshift-space distortion (RSD) measurements from BOSS in our companion papers. To further aid these analyses, we consider the optimum number of bins to use for two-point measurements using the monopole power spectrum or correlation function for BAO, and the monopole and quadrupole moments of the correlation function for anisotropic-BAO and RSD measurements.},

	Abstract = {The results from weak gravitational lensing analyses are subject to a cosmic variance error term that has previously been estimated assuming Gaussian statistics. In this Letter we address the issue of estimating cosmic variance errors for weak lensing surveys in the non-Gaussian regime.  Using standard cold dark matter model ray-tracing simulations characterized by Omegam = 0.3, OmegaLambda = 0.7, h = 0.7 and sigma8 = 1 for different survey redshifts zs, we determine the variance of the two-point shear correlation function measured across 64 independent lines of sight. We compare the measured variance to the variance expected from a random Gaussian field and derive a redshift-dependent non-Gaussian calibration relation.  We find that the ratio between the non-Gaussian and Gaussian variance at 1 arcmin can be as high as ~30 for a survey with source redshift zs ~ 0.5 and ~10 for zs ~ 1. The transition scale varthetac above which the ratio is consistent with unity is found to be varthetac ~ 20 arcmin for zs ~ 0.5 and varthetac ~ 10 arcmin for zs ~ 1. We provide fitting formulae to our results permitting the estimation of non-Gaussian cosmic variance errors, and discuss the impact on current and future surveys.  A more extensive set of simulations will, however, be required to investigate the dependence of our results on cosmology, specifically on the amplitude of clustering.},

@article{Taylor13,
	Abstract = {Cosmological parameter estimation requires that the likelihood function of the data is accurately known. Assuming that cosmological large-scale structure power spectra data are multivariate Gaussian distributed, we show that the accuracy of parameter estimation is limited by the accuracy of the inverse data covariance matrix - the precision matrix. If the data covariance and precision matrices are estimated by sampling independent realizations of the data, their statistical properties are described by the Wishart and inverse-Wishart distributions, respectively. Independent of any details of the survey, we show that the fractional error on a parameter variance, or a figure of merit, is equal to the fractional variance of the precision matrix. In addition, for the only unbiased estimator of the precision matrix, we find that the fractional accuracy of the parameter error depends only on the difference between the number of independent realizations and the number of data points, and so can easily diverge. For a 5 per cent error on a parameter error and ND ≪ 102 data points, a minimum of 200 realizations of the survey are needed, with 10 per cent accuracy in the data covariance. If the number of data points ND ≫ 102, we need NS > ND realizations and a fractional accuracy of <&surd;{2/N_D} in the data covariance. As the number of power spectra data points grows to ND > 104-106, this approach will be problematic. We discuss possible ways to relax these conditions: improved theoretical modelling, shrinkage methods, data compression, simulation and data resampling methods.},

@article{Hartlap07,
	Abstract = {Aims:The maximum-likelihood method is the standard approach to obtain model fits to observational data and the corresponding confidence regions. We investigate possible sources of bias in the log-likelihood function and its subsequent analysis, focusing on estimators of the inverse covariance matrix. Furthermore, we study under which circumstances the estimated covariance matrix is invertible.  Methods: We perform Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the behaviour of estimators for the inverse covariance matrix, depending on the number of independent data sets and the number of variables of the data vectors. Results: We find that the inverse of the maximum-likelihood estimator of the covariance is biased, the amount of bias depending on the ratio of the number of bins (data vector variables), p, to the number of data sets, n. This bias inevitably leads to an - in extreme cases catastrophic - underestimation of the size of confidence regions. We report on a method to remove this bias for the idealised case of Gaussian noise and statistically independent data vectors. Moreover, we demonstrate that marginalisation over parameters introduces a bias into the marginalised log-likelihood function. Measures of the sizes of confidence regions suffer from the same problem. Furthermore, we give an analytic proof for the fact that the estimated covariance matrix is singular if p>n.},

	Abstract = {The upcoming generation of galaxy surveys will probe the distribution of matter in the Universe with unprecedented accuracy. Measurements of the matter power spectrum at different scales and red shifts will provide stringent constraints on the cosmological parameters. However, on non-linear scales this will require an accurate evaluation of the covariance matrix. Here, we compute the covariance matrix of the three-dimensional matter density power spectrum for the concordance LambdaCDM cosmology from an ensemble of N-body simulations of the Dark Energy Universe Simulation - Parallel Universe Runs (DEUS-PUR). This consists of 12 288 realizations of a (656 h-1 Mpc)3 simulation box with 2563 particles. We combine this set with an auxiliary sample of 96 simulations of the same volume with 10243 particles. We find the N-body mass resolution effect to be an important source of systematic errors on the covariance at high redshift and small intermediate scales. We correct for this effect by introducing an empirical statistical method which provide an accurate determination of the covariance matrix over a wide range of scales including the baryon oscillations interval. Contrary to previous studies that used smaller N-body ensembles, we find the power spectrum distribution to significantly deviate from expectations of a Gaussian random density field at k ≳ 0.25 h Mpc-1 and z < 0.5. This suggests that for the finite-volume surveys, an unbiased estimate of the ensemble-averaged band power at these scales and red shifts may require a more careful assessment of non-Gaussian errors than previously considered.},

@article{Schneider11,
	Abstract = {We present an algorithm for quickly generating multiple realizations of N-body simulations to be used, for example, for cosmological parameter estimation from surveys of large-scale structure. Our algorithm uses a new method to resample the large-scale (Gaussian-distributed) Fourier modes in a periodic N-body simulation box in a manner that properly accounts for the nonlinear mode coupling between large and small scales. We find that our method for adding new large-scale mode realizations recovers the nonlinear power spectrum to sub-percent accuracy on scales larger than about half the Nyquist frequency of the simulation box. Using 20 N-body simulations, we obtain a power spectrum covariance matrix estimate that matches the estimator from Takahashi et al. (from 5000 simulations) with <20% errors in all matrix elements. Comparing the rates of convergence, we determine that our algorithm requires ~8 times fewer simulations to achieve a given error tolerance in estimates of the power spectrum covariance matrix. The degree of success of our algorithm indicates that we understand the main physical processes that give rise to the correlations in the matter power spectrum. Namely, the large-scale Fourier modes modulate both the degree of structure growth through the variation in the effective local matter density and also the spatial frequency of small-scale perturbations through large-scale displacements. We expect our algorithm to be useful for noise modeling when constraining cosmological parameters from weak lensing (cosmic shear) and galaxy surveys, rescaling summary statistics of N-body simulations for new cosmological parameter values, and any applications where the influence of Fourier modes larger than the simulation size must be accounted for.},

Assuming a fixed number of cosmological simulation runs, we describe how to build a `statistical emulator' of the two-point function covariance over a specified range of input cosmological parameters. Because the simulation runs with different cosmological models help to constrain the form of the covariance, we predict that the cosmology-dependent covariance may be estimated with a comparable number of simulations as would be needed to estimate the covariance for fixed cosmology.

Our model retains the common assumption of a multivariate normal distribution for the power spectrum band powers but takes full account of the (parameter-dependent) power spectrum covariance. The model is calibrated using an extension of the framework in Habib et al. (2007) to train Gaussian processes for the power spectrum mean and covariance given a set of simulation runs over a hypercube in parameter space. We demonstrate the performance of this machinery by estimating the parameters of a power-law model for the power spectrum. Within this framework, our calibrated sample variance distribution is robust to errors in the estimated covariance and shows rapid convergence of the posterior parameter constraints with the number of training simulations.},

	Abstract = {We seek to improve estimates of the power spectrum covariance matrix from a limited number of simulations by employing a novel statistical technique known as shrinkage estimation. The shrinkage technique optimally combines an empirical estimate of the covariance with a model (the target) to minimize the total mean squared error compared to the true underlying covariance. We test this technique on N-body simulations and evaluate its performance by estimating cosmological parameters. Using a simple diagonal target, we show that the shrinkage estimator significantly outperforms both the empirical covariance and the target individually when using a small number of simulations. We find that reducing noise in the covariance estimate is essential for properly estimating the values of cosmological parameters as well as their confidence intervals. We extend our method to the jackknife covariance estimator and again find significant improvement, though simulations give better results. Even for thousands of simulations we still find evidence that our method improves estimation of the covariance matrix. Because our method is simple, requires negligible additional numerical effort, and produces superior results, we always advocate shrinkage estimation for the covariance of the power spectrum and other large-scale structure measurements when purely theoretical modelling of the covariance is insufficient.},

	Abstract = {I propose a method to fit the probability distribution function (PDF) of the large-scale density field rho, motivated by a Lagrangian version of the continuity equation. It consists in applying the Edgeworth expansion to the quantity Phi identical with log rho - mean value of log rho. The method is tested on the matter particle distribution in two cold dark matter N-body simulations of different physical sizes to cover a large dynamic range. It is seen to be very efficient, even in the nonlinear regime, and may thus be used as an analytical tool to study the effect on the PDF of the transition between the weakly nonlinear regime and the highly nonlinear regime.},

	Abstract = {Owing to the mass-sheet degeneracy, cosmic shear maps do not probe directly the Fourier modes of the underlying mass distribution on scales comparable to the survey size and larger. To assess the corresponding effect on attainable cosmological parameter constraints, we quantify the information on supersurvey modes in a lognormal model and, when interpreted as nuisance parameters, their degeneracies to cosmological parameters. Our analytical and numerical calculations clarify the central role of supersample covariance in shaping the statistical power of cosmological observables. Reconstructing the background modes from their non-Gaussian statistical dependence to small-scale modes yields the renormalized convergence. This diagonalizes the spectrum covariance matrix, and the information content of the corresponding power spectrum is increased by a factor of 2 over standard methods. Unfortunately, careful calculation of the Cramer-Rao bound shows that the information recovery can never be made complete, any observable built from shear fields, including optimal sufficient statistics, is subject to severe information loss, typically 80-90 per cent below l ˜ 3000 for generic cosmological parameters. The lost information can only be recovered from additional, non-shear-based data. Our predictions hold just as well for a tomographic analysis, and/or full sky surveys.},

@article{Carron14b,
	Abstract = {The statistical translation invariance of cosmological random fields is broken by a finite survey boundary, correlating the observable Fourier modes. Standard methods for generating Gaussian fields either neglect these correlations, or are costly, or both. Here, we report on a fast and exact simulation method applicable to a wide class of two-point statistics that requires the simulation of a periodic grid of only twice the survey side with fast Fourier transforms. Supersurvey modes, dominating the covariance of power spectra beyond linear scales in galaxy surveys and causing the correlation of large and small scales, `beat coupling', or `super-sample' covariance, are precisely accounted for in non-linear transformations of the Gaussian field. As an application, we simulate the CFHTLS (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Large Survey) ˜7$\,^{\circ}$ × 7$\,^{\circ}$ W1 galaxy density field, modelled as a Poisson sampling of a lognormal density field. We show that our simulations produce power spectra, A*-power spectra, counts-in-cells probability distributions as well as covariances perfectly consistent with the data. In addition, our technique reproduces the information plateau beyond linear scales as observed previously in Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy catalogues and in N-body simulations. Our method is thus an efficient yet powerful simulation and prediction tool for galaxy survey data and covariances.},

@article{Takahashi14,
	Abstract = {Upcoming wide-area weak lensing surveys are expensive both in time and cost and require an optimal survey design in order to attain maximum scientific returns from a fixed amount of available telescope time. The supersample covariance (SSC), which arises from unobservable modes that are larger than the survey size, significantly degrades the statistical precision of weak lensing power spectrum measurement even for a wide-area survey. Using the 1000 mock realizations of the lognormal model, which approximates the weak lensing field for a Lambda-dominated cold dark matter model, we study an optimal survey geometry to minimize the impact of SSC contamination. For a continuous survey geometry with a fixed survey area, a more elongated geometry such as a rectangular shape of 1:400 side length ratio reduces the SSC effect and allows for a factor of 2 improvement in the cumulative signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of power spectrum measurement up to lmax ~= a few 103, compared to compact geometries such as squares or circles. When we allow the survey geometry to be disconnected but with a fixed total area, assuming 1 × 1 deg2 patches as the fundamental building blocks of survey footprints, the best strategy is to locate the patches with ˜15 deg separation. This separation angle corresponds to the scale at which the two-point correlation function has a negative minimum. The best configuration allows for a factor of 100 gain in the effective area coverage as well as a factor of 2.5 improvement in the S/N at high multipoles, yielding a much wider coverage of multipoles than in the compact geometry.},

	Abstract = {We present a Bayesian reconstruction algorithm to generate unbiased samples of the underlying dark matter field from halo catalogues. Our new contribution consists of implementing a non-Poisson likelihood including a deterministic non-linear and scale-dependent bias. In particular we present the Hamiltonian equations of motions for the negative binomial (NB) probability distribution function. This permits us to efficiently sample the posterior distribution function of density fields given a sample of galaxies using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo technique implemented in the ARGO code. We have tested our algorithm with the Bolshoi N-body simulation at redshift z = 0, inferring the underlying dark matter density field from subsamples of the halo catalogue with biases smaller and larger than one. Our method shows that we can draw closely unbiased samples (compatible within 1-sigma) from the posterior distribution up to scales of about k ˜ 1 h Mpc-1 in terms of power-spectra and cell-to-cell correlations. We find that a Poisson likelihood including a scale-dependent non-linear deterministic bias can yield reconstructions with power spectra deviating more than 10 per cent at k = 0.2 h Mpc-1. Our reconstruction algorithm is especially suited for emission line galaxy data for which a complex non-linear stochastic biasing treatment beyond Poissonity becomes indispensable.},

@article{Kitaura10,
	Abstract = {We present a general expression for a lognormal filter given an arbitrary non-linear galaxy bias. We derive this filter as the maximum a posteriori solution assuming a lognormal prior distribution for the matter field with a given mean field and modelling the observed galaxy distribution by a Poissonian process. We have performed a three-dimensional implementation of this filter with a very efficient Newton-Krylov inversion scheme. Furthermore, we have tested it with a dark matter N-body simulation assuming a unit galaxy bias relation and compared the results with previous density field estimators like the inverse weighting scheme and Wiener filtering. Our results show good agreement with the underlying dark matter field for overdensities even above delta ~ 1000 which exceeds by one order of magnitude the regime in which the lognormal is expected to be valid. The reason is that for our filter the lognormal assumption enters as a prior distribution function, but the maximum a posteriori solution is also conditioned on the data. We find that the lognormal filter is superior to the previous filtering schemes in terms of higher correlation coefficients and smaller Euclidean distances to the underlying matter field. We also show how it is able to recover the positive tail of the matter overdensity field distribution for a unit bias relation down to scales of about >~2Mpch-1.},

	Abstract = {We analyse the large-scale correlation function of the 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) and detect a baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal at 105 h-1 Mpc. The 6dFGS BAO detection allows us to constrain the distance-redshift relation at zeff= 0.106. We achieve a distance measure of DV(zeff) = 457 $\pm$ 27 Mpc and a measurement of the distance ratio, rs(zd)/DV(zeff) = 0.336 $\pm$ 0.015 (4.5 per cent precision), where rs(zd) is the sound horizon at the drag epoch zd. The low-effective redshift of 6dFGS makes it a competitive and independent alternative to Cepheids and low-z supernovae in constraining the Hubble constant. We find a Hubble constant of H0= 67 $\pm$ 3.2 km s-1 Mpc-1 (4.8 per cent precision) that depends only on the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe-7 (WMAP-7) calibration of the sound horizon and on the galaxy clustering in 6dFGS. Compared to earlier BAO studies at higher redshift, our analysis is less dependent on other cosmological parameters. The sensitivity to H0 can be used to break the degeneracy between the dark energy equation of state parameter w and H0 in the cosmic microwave background data. We determine that w=-0.97 $\pm$ 0.13, using only WMAP-7 and BAO data from both 6dFGS and Percival et al. (2010).  We also discuss predictions for the large-scale correlation function of two future wide-angle surveys: the Wide field ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) blind H I survey (with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, ASKAP) and the proposed Transforming Astronomical Imaging surveys through Polychromatic Analysis of Nebulae (TAIPAN) all-southern-sky optical galaxy survey with the UK Schmidt Telescope. We find that both surveys are very likely to yield detections of the BAO peak, making WALLABY the first radio galaxy survey to do so. We also predict that TAIPAN has the potential to constrain the Hubble constant with 3 per cent precision.},

@article{Cole05,
	Abstract = {We present a power-spectrum analysis of the final 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS), employing a direct Fourier method. The sample used comprises 221414 galaxies with measured redshifts. We investigate in detail the modelling of the sample selection, improving on previous treatments in a number of respects. A new angular mask is derived, based on revisions to the photometric calibration. The redshift selection function is determined by dividing the survey according to rest-frame colour, and deducing a self-consistent treatment of k-corrections and evolution for each population. The covariance matrix for the power-spectrum estimates is determined using two different approaches to the construction of mock surveys, which are used to demonstrate that the input cosmological model can be correctly recovered. We discuss in detail the possible differences between the galaxy and mass power spectra, and treat these using simulations, analytic models and a hybrid empirical approach. Based on these investigations, we are confident that the 2dFGRS power spectrum can be used to infer the matter content of the universe. On large scales, our estimated power spectrum shows evidence for the `baryon oscillations' that are predicted in cold dark matter (CDM) models. Fitting to a CDM model, assuming a primordial ns= 1 spectrum, h= 0.72 and negligible neutrino mass, the preferred parameters are Omegamh= 0.168 +/- 0.016 and a baryon fraction Omegab/Omegam= 0.185 +/- 0.046 (1sigma errors). The value of Omegamh is 1sigma lower than the 0.20 +/- 0.03 in our 2001 analysis of the partially complete 2dFGRS. This shift is largely due to the signal from the newly sampled regions of space, rather than the refinements in the treatment of observational selection. This analysis therefore implies a density significantly below the standard Omegam= 0.3: in combination with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), we infer Omegam= 0.231 +/- 0.021.},

	Abstract = {We measure the imprint of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) in the galaxy clustering pattern at the highest redshift achieved to date, z= 0.6, using the distribution of N= 132 509 emission-line galaxies in the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. We quantify BAOs using three statistics: the galaxy correlation function, power spectrum and the band-filtered estimator introduced by Xu et al. The results are mutually consistent, corresponding to a 4.0 per cent measurement of the cosmic distance-redshift relation at z= 0.6 [in terms of the acoustic parameter 'A(z)' introduced by Eisenstein et al., we find A(z= 0.6) = 0.452 $\pm$ 0.018]. Both BAOs and power spectrum shape information contribute towards these constraints. The statistical significance of the detection of the acoustic peak in the correlation function, relative to a wiggle-free model, is 3.2sigma. The ratios of our distance measurements to those obtained using BAOs in the distribution of luminous red galaxies at redshifts z= 0.2 and 0.35 are consistent with a flat Lambda cold dark matter model that also provides a good fit to the pattern of observed fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation. The addition of the current WiggleZ data results in a ≈30 per cent improvement in the measurement accuracy of a constant equation of state, w, using BAO data alone. Based solely on geometric BAO distance ratios, accelerating expansion (w < -1/3) is required with a probability of 99.8 per cent, providing a consistency check of conclusions based on supernovae observations. Further improvements in cosmological constraints will result when the WiggleZ survey data set is complete.},

	Abstract = {We quantitatively study the probability distribution function (PDF) of cosmological nonlinear density fluctuations from N-body simulations with a Gaussian initial condition. In particular, we examine the validity and limitations of one-point and two-point lognormal PDF models against those directly estimated from the simulations. We find that the one-point lognormal PDF very accurately describes the cosmological density distribution even in the nonlinear regime (rms variance sigmanl<~4, overdensity delta<~100). Furthermore, the two-point lognormal PDFs are also in good agreement with the simulation data from linear to fairly nonlinear regimes, while they deviate slightly from the simulation data for delta<~-0.5. Thus, the lognormal PDF can be used as a useful empirical model for the cosmological density fluctuations. While this conclusion is fairly insensitive to the shape of the underlying power spectrum of density fluctuations P(k), models with substantial power on large scales, i.e., n≡dlnP(k)/dlnk<~-1, are better described by the lognormal PDF. On the other hand, we note that the one-to-one mapping of the initial and evolved density fields, consistent with the lognormal model, does not approximate the broad distribution of their mutual correlation even on average. Thus, the origin of the phenomenological lognormal PDF approximation still remains to be understood.},

@article{Bernardeau95,
	Abstract = {The properties of the probability distribution function (PDF) of the cosmological continuous density field are studied. We focus our analysis on the quasi-linear regime where various calculations, based on dynamically motivated methods, have been presented: either by using the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA) or by using the perturbation theory to evaluate the behavior of the moments of the distribution function. We show how these two approaches are related to each other and that they can be used in a complementary way. For that respect, the one-dimensional dynamics, where the ZA is exact solution, has first been used as a testing ground. In particular, we show that, when the density PDF obtained with the ZA is regularized, its various moments exhibit the behavior expected by the perturbation theory applied to the ZA. We show that ZA approach can be used for arbitrary initial conditions (not only Gaussian) and that the nonlinear evolution of the moments can be obtained. The perturbation theory can be used for the exact dynamics. We take into account the final filtering of the density field both for ZA and perturbation theory. Applying these techniques, we got the generating function of the moments for the one-dimensional dynamics, the three-dimensional ZA, with and without smoothing effects. We also suggest methods to build PDFs. One is based on the Laplace inverse transform of the moment generating function. The other, the Edgeworth expansion, is obtained when the previous generating function is truncated at a given order and allows evaluation of the PDF out of limited number of moments. It provides insight on the relationship between the moments and the shape of the density PDF. In particular, it provides an alternative method to evaluate the skewness and kurtosis by measuring the PDF around its maximum. Eventually, results obtained from a numerical simulation with cold dark matter initial conditions have been used to validate the accuracy of the considered approximations. We explain the successful log-normal fit of the PDF from that simulation at moderate sigma as mere fortune, but not as a universal form of density PDF in general.},

	Abstract = {The use of a lognormal (LN) random field, non-Gaussian random field as a model for the distribution of matter in the universe is discussed. As the general LN field includes the Gaussian case in the limit of zero rms fluctuation it is possible to perform a statistical decomposition. The statistical properties of the model can be formulated in terms of one covariance function. Difficulties with the statistical treatment of density perturbations such as the fact that the LN model is not completely specified by its moments have been revealed by analysis of the model. It is shown that for discriminating between Gaussian and non-Gaussian fluctuations the method of representing the three- and four-point correlation functions of galaxies in terms of the parameters Q and R is not useful. Parameterizations in terms of the skewness and kurtosis are proposed.},

	Abstract = {Numerical N-body simulations play a central role in the assessment of weak gravitational lensing statistics, residual systematics and error analysis. In this paper, we investigate and quantify the impact of finite simulation volume on weak lensing two- and four-point statistics. These finite support (FS) effects are modelled for several estimators, simulation box sizes and source redshifts, and validated against a new large suite of 500 N-body simulations. The comparison reveals that our theoretical model is accurate to better than 5 per cent for the shear correlation function xi+(theta) and its error. We find that the most important quantities for FS modelling are the ratio between the measured angle theta and the angular size of the simulation box at the source redshift, thetabox(zs), or the multipole equivalent l/lbox(zs). When this ratio reaches 0.1, independently of the source redshift, the shear correlation function xi+ is suppressed by 5, 10, 20 and 25 per cent for Lbox = 1000, 500, 250 and 147 h-1 Mpc, respectively. The same effect is observed in xi-(theta), but at much larger angles. This has important consequences for cosmological analyses using N-body simulations and should not be overlooked. We propose simple semi-analytic correction strategies that account for shape noise and survey masks, generalizable to any weak lensing estimator. From the same simulation suite, we revisit the existing non-Gaussian covariance matrix calibration of the shear correlation function, and propose a new one based on the 9-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe)+baryon acoustic oscillations+supernova cosmology. Our calibration matrix is accurate at 20 per cent down to the arcminute scale, for source redshifts in the range 0 < z < 3, even for the far off-diagonal elements. We propose, for the first time, a parametrization for the full xi- covariance matrix, also 20 per cent accurate for most elements.},

@article{Desjacques08c,
	Abstract = {N-body simulations have demonstrated a correlation between the properties of haloes and their environment. In this paper, we assess whether the ellipsoidal collapse model, whose dynamics includes the tidal shear, can produce a similar dependence. First, we explore the statistical correlation that originates from Gaussian initial conditions. We derive analytic expressions for a number of joint statistics of the shear tensor and estimate the sensitivity of the local characteristics of the shear to the global geometry of the large-scale environment. Next, we concentrate on the dynamical aspect of the environmental dependence using a simplified model that takes into account the interaction between a collapsing halo and its environment. We find that the tidal force exerted by the surrounding mass distribution alters the axes collapse and causes haloes embedded in overdense regions to virialize earlier. The environment density is the key parameter in determining the virialization redshift, while the environment asphericity primarily contributes to the increase in the scatter of the critical collapse density. An effective density threshold whose shape depends on the large-scale density provides a good description of this environmental effect. Such an interpretation has the advantage that the excursion set formalism can be applied to quantify the environmental dependence of halo properties. We show that, using this approach, a correlation between formation redshift, large-scale bias and environment density naturally arises. The strength of the effect is comparable, albeit smaller, to that seen in simulations. It is largest for low-mass haloes (M << M*), and decreases as one goes to higher mass objects (M > M*). Furthermore, haloes that formed early are substantially more clustered than those that assembled recently. On the other hand, our analytic model predicts a decrease in median formation redshift with increasing environment density, in disagreement with the trend detected in overdense regions. However, our results appear consistent with the behaviour inferred in relatively underdense regions. We argue that the ellipsoidal collapse model may apply in low-density environments where non-linear effects are negligible.},

	Abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to investigate the Lagrangian bias of cold dark matter haloes within the Lambda cold dark matter cosmology. Our analysis focuses on 'protohaloes' that we identify in the simulation initial conditions with the subsets of particles belonging to individual redshift-zero haloes. We then calculate the number density and velocity divergence fields of protohaloes and estimate their autospectral densities. We also measure the corresponding cross-spectral densities with the linear matter distribution. We use our results to test a Lagrangian bias model presented by Desjacques & Sheth which is based on the assumption that haloes form out of local density maxima of a specific height. Our comparison validates the predicted functional form for the scale dependence of the bias for both the density and the velocity fields. We also show that the bias coefficients are accurately predicted for the velocity divergence. In contrast, the theoretical values for the density bias parameters do not accurately match the numerical results as a function of halo mass. This is likely due to the simplistic assumptions that relate virialized haloes to density peaks of a given height in the model. We also detect appreciable stochasticity for the Lagrangian density bias, even on very large scales. These are not included in the model at leading order but correspond to higher order corrections.},

Our derivation, which is valid on linear scales k≲0.1hMpc-1, is based on the peak biasing relation given by Desjacques [Phys. Rev. DPRVDAQ1550-7998, 78, 103503 (2008)10.1103/PhysRevD.78.103503]. In linear theory, the redshift space power spectrum is Ppks(k,mu)=expf (-f2sigmavel2k2mu2)[bpk(k)+bvel(k)fmu2]2Pdelta(k), where mu is the angle with respect to the line of sight, sigmavel is the one-dimensional velocity dispersion, f is the growth rate, and bpk(k) and bvel(k) are k-dependent linear spatial and velocity bias factors. For peaks, the value of sigmavel depends upon the functional form of bvel. When the k dependence is absent from the square brackets and bvel is set to unity, the resulting expression is assumed to describe models where the bias is linear and deterministic, but the velocities are unbiased. The peak model is remarkable because it has unbiased velocities in this same sense---peak motions are driven by dark matter flows---but, in order to achieve this, bvel must be k dependent. We speculate that this is true in general: k dependence of the spatial bias will lead to k dependence of bvel even if the biased tracers flow with the dark matter. Because of the k dependence of the linear bias parameters, standard manipulations applied to the peak model will lead to k-dependent estimates of the growth factor that could erroneously be interpreted as a signature of modified dark energy or gravity. We use the Fisher formalism to show that the constraint on the growth rate f is degraded by a factor of 2 if one allows for a k-dependent velocity bias of the peak type. Our analysis also demonstrates that the Gaussian smoothing term is part and parcel of linear theory. We discuss a simple estimate of nonlinear evolution and illustrate the effect of the peak bias on the redshift space multipoles. For k≲0.1hMpc-1, the peak bias is deterministic but k dependent, so the configuration-space bias is stochastic and scale dependent, both in real and redshift space. We provide expressions for this stochasticity and its evolution.},

	Abstract = {We reexamine the two-point correlation of density maxima in Gaussian initial conditions. Spatial derivatives of the linear density correlation, which were ignored in the calculation of Bardeen et al. [Astrophys. J. 304, 15 (1986)ASJOAB0004-637X10.1086/164143], are included in our analysis. These functions exhibit large oscillations around the sound horizon scale for generic cold dark matter (CDM) power spectra. We derive the exact leading-order expression for the correlation of density peaks and demonstrate the contribution of those spatial derivatives. In particular, we show that these functions can modify significantly the baryon acoustic signature of density maxima relative to that of the linear density field. The effect depends upon the exact value of the peak height, the filter shape and size, and the small-scale behavior of the transfer function. In the LambdaCDM cosmology, for maxima identified in the density field smoothed at mass scale M≈1012 1014M&sun;/h and with linear threshold height nu=1.673/sigma(M), the contrast of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) can be a few tens of percent larger than in the linear matter correlation. Overall, the BAO is amplified for nu≳1 and damped for nu≲1. Density maxima thus behave quite differently than linearly biased tracers of the density field, whose acoustic signature is a simple scaled version of the linear baryon acoustic oscillation. We also calculate the mean streaming of peak pairs in the quasilinear regime. We show that the leading-order 2-point correlation and pairwise velocity of density peaks are consistent with a nonlinear, local biasing relation involving gradients of the density field. Biasing will be an important issue in ascertaining how much of the enhancement of the BAO in the primeval correlation of density maxima propagates into the late-time clustering of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Large-scale structures originate from coherent motions induced by inhomogeneities in the primeval gravitational potential. Here, we investigate the two-point statistics of the second derivative of the potential, the tidal shear, under the assumption of Gaussianity. We derive an exact closed form expression for the angular averaged, two-point distribution of the shear components which is valid for an arbitrary Lagrangian separation. This result is used to write down the two-point statistics of the shear eigenvalues in compact form. Next, we examine the large-scale asymptotics of the correlation of the shear eigenvalues and the alignment of the principal axes. The analytic results are in good agreement with measurements obtained from random realizations of the gravitational potential. Finally, we show that a number of two-point distributions of the shear eigenvalues are well approximated by Gaussian bivariates over a wide range of separation and smoothing scales. We speculate that the Gaussian approximation also holds for multiple point distributions of the shear eigenvalues. It is hoped that these results will be relevant for studies aimed at describing the properties of the (evolved) matter distribution in terms of the statistics of the primordial shear field.},

	Abstract = {We present a new technique to measure neutrino masses using their flow field relative to dark matter. Present day streaming motions of neutrinos relative to dark matter and baryons are several hundred km /s, comparable with their thermal velocity dispersion. This results in a unique dipole anisotropic distortion of the matter-neutrino cross power spectrum, which is observable through the dipole distortion in the cross correlation of different galaxy populations. Such a dipole vanishes if not for this relative velocity and so it is a clean signature for neutrino mass. We estimate the size of this effect and find that current and future galaxy surveys may be sensitive to these signature distortions.},

	Abstract = {Cosmic shear can only be measured where there are galaxies. This source-lens clustering (SLC) effect has two sources, intrinsic source clustering and cosmic magnification (magnification/size bias). Lensing tomography can suppress the former. However, this reduction is limited by the existence of photo-z error and nonzero redshift bin width. Furthermore, SLC induced by cosmic magnification cannot be reduced by lensing tomography. Through N-body simulations, we quantify the impact of SLC on the lensing power spectrum in the context of lensing tomography. We consider both the standard estimator and the pixel-based estimator. We find that none of them can satisfactorily handle both sources of SLC. (1) For the standard estimator, SLC induced by both sources can bias the lensing power spectrum by O(1)--O(10)\%. Intrinsic source clustering also increases statistical uncertainties in the measured lensing power spectrum. However, the standard estimator suppresses intrinsic source clustering in the cross-spectrum. (2) In contrast, the pixel-based estimator suppresses SLC through cosmic magnification. However, it fails to suppress SLC through intrinsic source clustering and the measured lensing power spectrum can be biased low by O(1)--O(10)\%. In short, for typical photo-z errors ({sigma}_z)/(1+z)=0.05) and photo-z bin sizes ({Delta}{{z}^P}=0.2), SLC alters the lensing E-mode power spectrum by 1--10\%, with \ell ~ {{10}^3} and {{z}_s}~ 1 being of particular interest to weak lensing cosmology. Therefore the SLC is a severe systematic for cosmology in Stage-IV lensing surveys. We present useful scaling relations to self-calibrate the SLC effect.},

@article{Myers09,
	Abstract = {The use of photometric redshifts in cosmology is increasing. Often, however these photo-z are treated like spectroscopic observations, in that the peak of the photometric redshift, rather than the full probability density function (PDF), is used. This overlooks useful information inherent in the full PDF. We introduce a new real-space estimator for one of the most used cosmological statistics, the two-point correlation function, that weights by the PDF of individual photometric objects in a manner that is optimal when Poisson statistics dominate. As our estimator does not bin based on the PDF peak, it substantially enhances the clustering signal by usefully incorporating information from all photometric objects that overlap the redshift bin of interest. As a real-world application, we measure quasi-stellar object (QSO) clustering in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that our simplest binned estimator improves the clustering signal by a factor equivalent to increasing the survey size by a factor of 2-3. We also introduce a new implementation that fully weights between pairs of objects in constructing the cross-correlation and find that this pair-weighted estimator improves clustering signal in a manner equivalent to increasing the survey size by a factor of 4-5. Our technique uses spectroscopic data to anchor the distance scale and it will be particularly useful where spectroscopic data (e.g. from BOSS) overlap deeper photometry (e.g. from Pan-STARRS, DES or the LSST). We additionally provide simple, informative expressions to determine when our estimator will be competitive with the autocorrelation of spectroscopic objects. Although we use QSOs as an example population, our estimator can and should be applied to any clustering estimate that uses photometric objects.},

@article{Bernstein10,
	Abstract = {We study the sensitivity of weak-lensing surveys to the effects of catastrophic redshift errors - cases where the true redshift is mis-estimated by a significant amount. To compute the biases in cosmological parameters, we adopt an efficient linearized analysis where the redshift errors are directly related to shifts in the weak-lensing convergence power spectra. We estimate the number Nspec of unbiased spectroscopic redshifts needed to determine the catastrophic error rate well enough that biases in cosmological parameters are below statistical errors of weak-lensing tomography. While the straightforward estimate of Nspec is ~106, we find that using only the photometric redshifts with z <~ 2.5 leads to a drastic reduction in Nspec to ~30000 while negligibly increasing statistical errors in dark-energy parameters. Therefore, the size of the spectroscopic survey needed to control catastrophic errors is similar to that previously deemed necessary to constrain the core of the zs-zp distribution. We also study the efficacy of the recent proposal to measure redshift errors by cross-correlation between the photo-z and spectroscopic samples. We find that this method requires ~10 per cent a priori knowledge of the bias and stochasticity of the outlier population, and is also easily confounded by lensing magnification bias. The cross-correlation method is therefore unlikely to supplant the need for a complete spectroscopic-redshift survey of the source population.},

@article{Zhang10a,
	Abstract = {Photometric redshift (photo-z) errors, especially catastrophic errors, are a major uncertainty for precision weak-lensing cosmology. We find that the shear (galaxy number) density and density-density cross-correlation measurements between photo-z bins, available from the same lensing surveys, contain valuable information for self-calibration of the scattering probabilities between the true redshift and photo-z bins. The self-calibration technique we propose does not rely on cosmological priors nor parameterization of the photo-z probability distribution function, and preserves all of the cosmological information available from shear-shear measurement. We estimate the calibration accuracy through the Fisher matrix formalism. We find that, for advanced lensing surveys such as the planned Stage IV surveys, the rate of photo-z outliers can be determined with statistical uncertainties of 0.01-1 per cent for z < 2 galaxies. Among the several sources of calibration error that we identify and investigate, the galaxy distribution bias is likely the most dominant systematic error, whereby photo-z outliers have different redshift distributions and/or bias than non-outliers from the same bin. This bias affects all photo-z calibration techniques based on correlation measurements. Galaxy bias variations of O(0.1) produce biases in photo-z outlier rates similar to the statistical errors of our method, so this galaxy distribution bias may bias the reconstructed scatters at several-sigma level, but is unlikely to completely invalidate the self-calibration technique.},

(1) We propose a method to extract the intrinsic ellipticity-galaxy density cross-correlation (I-g) from the galaxy ellipticity-density measurement in the same redshift bin. (2) We also find a generic scaling relation to convert the extracted I-g correlation to the necessary GI correlation. We perform a concept study under simplified conditions and demonstrate its capability to significantly reduce GI contamination. We discuss the impact of various complexities on the two key ingredients of the self-calibration technique, namely the method for extracting the I-g correlation and the scaling relation between the I-g and the GI correlation. We expect that none of them will likely be able to completely invalidate the proposed self-calibration technique.},

@article{Matthews10,
	Abstract = {Many of the cosmological tests to be performed by planned dark energy experiments will require extremely well-characterized photometric redshift measurements. Current estimates for cosmic shear are that the true mean redshift of the objects in each photo-z bin must be known to better than 0.002(1 + z), and the width of the bin must be known to ~0.003(1 + z) if errors in cosmological measurements are not to be degraded significantly. A conventional approach is to calibrate these photometric redshifts with large sets of spectroscopic redshifts. However, at the depths probed by Stage III surveys (such as DES), let alone Stage IV (LSST, JDEM, and Euclid), existing large redshift samples have all been highly (25%-60%) incomplete, with a strong dependence of success rate on both redshift and galaxy properties. A powerful alternative approach is to exploit the clustering of galaxies to perform photometric redshift calibrations. Measuring the two-point angular cross-correlation between objects in some photometric redshift bin and objects with known spectroscopic redshift, as a function of the spectroscopic z, allows the true redshift distribution of a photometric sample to be reconstructed in detail, even if it includes objects too faint for spectroscopy or if spectroscopic samples are highly incomplete. We test this technique using mock DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift survey light cones constructed from the Millennium Simulation semi-analytic galaxy catalogs. From this realistic test, which incorporates the effects of galaxy bias evolution and cosmic variance, we find that the true redshift distribution of a photometric sample can, in fact, be determined accurately with cross-correlation techniques. We also compare the empirical error in the reconstruction of redshift distributions to previous analytic predictions, finding that additional components must be included in error budgets to match the simulation results. This extra error contribution is small for surveys that sample large areas of sky (>~10$\,^{\circ}$-100$\,^{\circ}$), but dominant for ~1 deg2 fields. We conclude by presenting a step-by-step, optimized recipe for reconstructing redshift distributions from cross-correlation information using standard correlation measurements.},

@article{Benjamin10,
	Abstract = {We present a new technique to estimate the level of contamination between photometric redshift bins. If the true angular cross-correlation between redshift bins can be safely assumed to be zero, any measured cross-correlation is a result of contamination between the bins. We present the theory for an arbitrary number of redshift bins, and discuss in detail the case of two and three bins which can be easily solved analytically. We use mock catalogues constructed from the Millennium Simulation to test the method, showing that artificial contamination can be successfully recovered with our method. We find that degeneracies in the parameter space prohibit us from determining a unique solution for the contamination, though constraints are made which can be improved with larger data sets. We then apply the method to an observational galaxy survey: the deep component of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. We estimate the level of contamination between photometric redshift bins and demonstrate our ability to reconstruct both the true redshift distribution and the true average redshift of galaxies in each photometric bin.},

	Abstract = {This white paper describes the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC), whose goal is the study of dark energy and related topics in fundamental physics with data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). It provides an overview of dark energy science and describes the current and anticipated state of the field. It makes the case for the DESC by laying out a robust analytical framework for dark energy science that has been defined by its members and the comprehensive three-year work plan they have developed for implementing that framework. The analysis working groups cover five key probes of dark energy: weak lensing, large scale structure, galaxy clusters, Type Ia supernovae, and strong lensing. The computing working groups span cosmological simulations, galaxy catalogs, photon simulations and a systematic software and computational framework for LSST dark energy data analysis. The technical working groups make the connection between dark energy science and the LSST system. The working groups have close linkages, especially through the use of the photon simulations to study the impact of instrument design and survey strategy on analysis methodology and cosmological parameter estimation. The white paper describes several high priority tasks identified by each of the 16 working groups. Over the next three years these tasks will help prepare for LSST analysis, make synergistic connections with ongoing cosmological surveys and provide the dark energy community with state of the art analysis tools. Members of the community are invited to join the LSST DESC, according to the membership policies described in the white paper. Applications to sign up for associate membership may be made by submitting the Web form at http://www.slac.stanford.edu/exp/lsst/desc/signup.html with a short statement of the work they wish to pursue that is relevant to the LSST DESC.},

@article{Joachimi10,
	Abstract = {Aims: Cosmic shear is a powerful method to constrain cosmology, provided that any systematic effects are under control. The intrinsic alignment of galaxies is expected to severely bias parameter estimates if not taken into account. We explore the potential of a joint analysis of tomographic galaxy ellipticity, galaxy number density, and ellipticity-number density cross-correlations to simultaneously constrain cosmology and self-calibrate unknown intrinsic alignment and galaxy bias contributions.  Methods: We treat intrinsic alignments and galaxy biasing as free functions of scale and redshift and marginalise over the resulting parameter sets. Constraints on cosmology are calculated by combining the likelihoods from all two-point correlations between galaxy ellipticity and galaxy number density. The information required for these calculations is already available in a standard cosmic shear data set. We include contributions to these functions from cosmic shear, intrinsic alignments, galaxy clustering and magnification effects.  Results: In a Fisher matrix analysis we compare our constraints with those from cosmic shear alone in the absence of intrinsic alignments. For a potential future large area survey, such as Euclid, the extra information from the additional correlation functions can make up for the additional free parameters in the intrinsic alignment and galaxy bias terms, depending on the flexibility in the models. For example, the dark energy task force figure of merit is recovered even when more than 100 free parameters are marginalised over. We find that the redshift quality requirements are similar to those calculated in the absence of intrinsic alignments.},

@article{Schulz10,
	Abstract = {The next generation of proposed galaxy surveys will increase the number of galaxies with photometric redshift identifications by two orders of magnitude, drastically expanding both the redshift range and detection threshold from the current state of the art. Obtaining spectra for a fair subsample of these new data could be cumbersome and expensive. However, adequate calibration of the true redshift distribution of galaxies is vital to tapping the potential of these surveys to illuminate the processes of galaxy evolution and to constrain the underlying cosmology and growth of structure. We examine here an alternative to direct spectroscopic follow-up: calibration of the redshift distribution of photometric galaxies via cross-correlation with an overlapping spectroscopic survey whose members trace the same density field. We review the theory, develop a pipeline to implement the method, apply it to mock data from N-body simulations, and examine the properties of this redshift distribution estimator. We demonstrate that the method is generally effective, but the estimator is weakened by two main factors. One is that the correlation function of the spectroscopic sample must be measured in many bins along the line of sight, which renders the measurement noisy and interferes with high-quality reconstruction of the photometric redshift distribution. Also, the method is not able to disentangle the photometric redshift distribution from redshift dependence in the bias of the photometric sample. We establish the impact of these factors using our mock catalogs. We conclude that it may still be necessary to spectroscopically follow up a fair subsample of the photometric survey data. Nonetheless, it is significant that the method has been successfully implemented on mock data, and with further refinement it may appreciably decrease the number of spectra that will be needed to calibrate future surveys.},

@article{Quadri10,
	Abstract = {Much of the science that is made possible by multiwavelength redshift surveys requires the use of photometric redshifts. But as these surveys become more ambitious, and as we seek to perform increasingly accurate measurements, it becomes crucial to take proper account of the photometric redshift uncertainties. Ideally the uncertainties can be directly measured using a comparison with spectroscopic redshifts, but this may yield misleading results since spectroscopic samples are frequently small and not representative of the parent photometric samples. We present a simple and powerful empirical method to constrain photometric redshift uncertainties in the absence of spectroscopic redshifts. Close pairs of galaxies on the sky have a significant probability of being physically associated and therefore of lying at nearly the same redshift. The difference in photometric redshifts in close pairs is therefore a measure of the redshift uncertainty. Some observed close pairs will arise from chance projections along the line of sight, but it is straightforward to perform a statistical correction for this effect. We demonstrate the technique using both simulated data and actual observations, and discuss how its usefulness can be limited by the presence of systematic photometric redshift errors.

	Abstract = {Cross correlations between the galaxy number density in a lensing source sample and that in an overlapping spectroscopic sample can in principle be used to calibrate the lensing source redshift distribution. In this paper, we study in detail to what extent this cross-correlation method can mitigate the loss of cosmological information in upcoming weak lensing surveys (combined with a cosmic microwave background prior) due to lack of knowledge of the source distribution. We consider a scenario where photometric redshifts are available and find that, unless the photometric redshift distribution p(z ph|z) is calibrated very accurately a priori (bias and scatter known to ~0.002 for, e.g., EUCLID), the additional constraint on p(z ph|z) from the cross-correlation technique to a large extent restores the cosmological information originally lost due to the uncertainty in dn/dz(z). Considering only the gain in photo-z accuracy and not the additional cosmological information, enhancements of the dark energy figure of merit of up to a factor of four (40) can be achieved for a SuMIRe-like (EUCLID-like) combination of lensing and redshift surveys, where SuMIRe stands for Subaru Measurement of Images and Redshifts). However, the success of the method is strongly sensitive to our knowledge of the galaxy bias evolution in the source sample and we find that a percent level bias prior is needed to optimize the gains from the cross-correlation method (i.e., to approach the cosmology constraints attainable if the bias was known exactly).},

@article{McQuinn13,
	Abstract = {We investigate how well the redshift distribution of a population of extragalactic objects can be reconstructed using angular cross-correlations with a sample whose redshifts are known. We derive the minimum variance quadratic estimator, which has simple analytic representations in very applicable limits and is significantly more sensitive than earlier proposed estimation procedures. This estimator is straightforward to apply to observations, it robustly finds the likelihood maximum and it conveniently selects angular scales at which fluctuations are well approximated as independent between redshift bins and at which linear theory applies. We find that the linear bias times number of objects in a redshift bin generally can be constrained with cross-correlations to fractional error ≈ &surd;102 Nbin/N, where N is the total number of spectra per dz and Nbin is the number of redshift bins spanned by the bulk of the unknown population. The error is often independent of the sky area and sampling fraction. Furthermore, we find that sub-per cent measurements of the angular source density per unit redshift, dN/dz, are in principle possible, although cosmic magnification needs to be accounted for at fractional errors of ≲10 per cent. We discuss how the sensitivity to dN/dz changes as a function of photometric and spectroscopic depth and how to optimize the survey strategy to constrain dN/dz. We also quantify how well cross-correlations of photometric redshift bins can be used to self-calibrate a photometric redshift sample. Simple formulae that can be quickly applied to gauge the utility of cross-correlating different samples are given.},

@article{Schneider06,
	Abstract = {We investigate how well the redshift distributions of galaxies sorted into photometric redshift bins can be determined from the galaxy angular two-point correlation functions. We find that the uncertainty in the reconstructed redshift distributions depends critically on the number of parameters used in each redshift bin and the range of angular scales used, but not on the number of photometric redshift bins. Using six parameters for each photometric redshift bin, and restricting ourselves to angular scales over which the galaxy number counts are normally distributed, we find that errors in the reconstructed redshift distributions are large; i.e., they would be the dominant source of uncertainty in cosmological parameters estimated from otherwise ideal weak lensing or baryon acoustic oscillation data. However, either by reducing the number of free parameters in each redshift bin or by (unjustifiably) applying our Gaussian analysis into the non-Gaussian regime, we find that the correlation functions can be used to reconstruct the redshift distributions with moderate precision; e.g., with mean redshifts determined to ~0.01. We also find that dividing the galaxies into two spectral types, thereby doubling the number of redshift distribution parameters, can result in a reduction in the errors in the combined redshift distributions.},

@article{wangyun08,
	Abstract = {The observed cosmic acceleration today could be due to an unknown energy component (dark energy), or a modification to general relativity (modified gravity). If dark energy models and modified gravity models are required to predict the same cosmic expansion history H(z), they will predict different growth rates for cosmic large scale structure, fg(z). If gravity is not modified, the measured H(z) leads to a unique prediction for fg(z), fgH(z), if dark energy and dark matter are separate. Comparing fgH(z) with the measured fg(z) provides a transparent and straightforward test of gravity. We show that a simple chi2 test provides a general figure of merit for our ability to distinguish between dark energy and modified gravity given the measured H(z) and fg(z). We find that a magnitude-limited NIR galaxy redshift survey covering >10 000 (deg)2 and a redshift range of 0.5<z<2 can be used to measure H(z) to 1-2% accuracy via baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, and fg(z) to the accuracy of a few per cent via the measurement of redshift-space distortions and the bias factor which describes how light traces mass. We show that if the H(z) data are fitted by both a DGP gravity model and an equivalent dark energy model that predict the same H(z), a survey area of 11 931 (deg)2 is required to rule out the DGP gravity model at the 99.99% confidence level. It is feasible for such a galaxy redshift survey to be carried out by the next generation space missions from NASA and ESA, and it will revolutionize our understanding of the universe by differentiating between dark energy and modified gravity.},

	Abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated by some form of ``dark energy'' with exotic physical properties, or that Einstein's theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious efforts to understand its origin, with experiments that aim to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and the abundance of galaxy clusters. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit ``Stage IV'' dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski effect, and direct measurements of the Hubble constant H0. We present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from General Relativity, achievable with Stage III and Stage IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background data. We also show the level of precision required for clusters or other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic acceleration produce data sets that support a wide range of scientific investigations, and they continue the longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater detail over ever larger scales.},

@article{Joyce15,
	Abstract = {After a decade and a half of research motivated by the accelerating universe, theory and experiment have reached a certain level of maturity. The development of theoretical models beyond Lambda or smooth dark energy, often called modified gravity, has led to broader insights into a path forward, and a host of observational and experimental tests have been developed. In this review we present the current state of the field and describe a framework for anticipating developments in the next decade. We identify the guiding principles for rigorous and consistent modifications of the standard model, and discuss the prospects for empirical tests.  We begin by reviewing recent attempts to consistently modify Einstein gravity in the infrared, focusing on the notion that additional degrees of freedom introduced by the modification must "screen" themselves from local tests of gravity. We categorize screening mechanisms into three broad classes: mechanisms which become active in regions of high Newtonian potential, those in which first derivatives of the field become important, and those for which second derivatives of the field are important. Examples of the first class, such as f(R) gravity, employ the familiar chameleon or symmetron mechanisms, whereas examples of the last class are galileon and massive gravity theories, employing the Vainshtein mechanism. In each case, we describe the theories as effective theories and discuss prospects for completion in a more fundamental theory. We describe experimental tests of each class of theories, summarizing laboratory and solar system tests and describing in some detail astrophysical and cosmological tests. Finally, we discuss prospects for future tests which will be sensitive to different signatures of new physics in the gravitational sector.  The review is structured so that those parts that are more relevant to theorists vs. observers/experimentalists are clearly indicated, in the hope that this will serve as a useful reference for both audiences, as well as helping those interested in bridging the gap between them.},

@article{Koyama15,
	Abstract = {Einstein's theory of General Relativity (GR) is tested accurately within the local universe i.e., the Solar System, but this leaves open the possibility that it is not a good description at the largest scales in the Universe. The standard model of cosmology assumes GR as the theory to describe gravity on all scales. In 1998, astronomers made the surprising discovery that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating, not slowing down. This late-time acceleration of the Universe has become the most challenging problem in theoretical physics. Within the framework of GR, the acceleration would originate from an unknown dark energy. Alternatively, it could be that there is no dark energy and GR itself is in error on cosmological scales. The standard model of cosmology is based on a huge extrapolation of our limited knowledge of gravity. This discovery of the late time acceleration of the Universe may require us to revise the theory of gravity and the standard model of cosmology based on GR. We will review recent progress in constructing modified gravity models as an alternative to dark energy and developing cosmological tests of gravity.},

	Abstract = {In this review we present a thoroughly comprehensive survey of recent work on modified theories of gravity and their cosmological consequences. Amongst other things, we cover General Relativity, scalar-tensor, Einstein-{\ae}ther, and Bimetric theories, as well as TeVeS, f(R), general higher-order theories, Horava-Lifschitz gravity, Galileons, Ghost Condensates, and models of extra dimensions including Kaluza-Klein, Randall-Sundrum, DGP, and higher co-dimension braneworlds. We also review attempts to construct a Parameterised Post-Friedmannian formalism, that can be used to constrain deviations from General Relativity in cosmology, and that is suitable for comparison with data on the largest scales. These subjects have been intensively studied over the past decade, largely motivated by rapid progress in the field of observational cosmology that now allows, for the first time, precision tests of fundamental physics on the scale of the observable Universe. The purpose of this review is to provide a reference tool for researchers and students in cosmology and gravitational physics, as well as a self-contained, comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to the subject as a whole.},

@article{Reyes10,
	Abstract = {Although general relativity underlies modern cosmology, its applicability on cosmological length scales has yet to be stringently tested. Such a test has recently been proposed, using a quantity, EG, that combines measures of large-scale gravitational lensing, galaxy clustering and structure growth rate. The combination is insensitive to `galaxy bias' (the difference between the clustering of visible galaxies and invisible dark matter) and is thus robust to the uncertainty in this parameter. Modified theories of gravity generally predict values of EG different from the general relativistic prediction because, in these theories, the `gravitational slip' (the difference between the two potentials that describe perturbations in the gravitational metric) is non-zero, which leads to changes in the growth of structure and the strength of the gravitational lensing effect. Here we report that EG = 0.39+/-0.06 on length scales of tens of megaparsecs, in agreement with the general relativistic prediction of EG~0.4. The measured value excludes a model within the tensor-vector-scalar gravity theory, which modifies both Newtonian and Einstein gravity. However, the relatively large uncertainty still permits models within f() theory, which is an extension of general relativity. A fivefold decrease in uncertainty is needed to rule out these models.},

@article{Acquaviva08,
	Abstract = {Cosmologists are exploring two possible sets of explanations for the remarkable observation of cosmic acceleration: dark energy fills space or general relativity fails on cosmological scales. We define a null test parameter gamma(k,a)≡Omegam-gammadlnf D/dlnf a-1, where a is the scale factor, D is the growth rate of structure, Omegam(a) is the matter density parameter, and gamma is a simple function of redshift. We show that it can be expressed entirely in terms of the bias factor, b(a), measured from cross correlations with cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing, and the amplitude of redshift-space distortions, beta(k,a). Measurements of the CMB power spectrum determine Omegam0H02. If dark energy within general relativity is the solution to the cosmic acceleration problem, then the logarithmic growth rate of structure dlnf D/dlnf a=Omegamgamma. Thus, gamma(k,a)=0 on linear scales to better than 1%. We show that in the class of modified gravity models known as f(R), the growth rate has a different dependence on scale and redshift. By combining measurements of the amplitude of beta and of the bias, b, redshift surveys will be able to determine the logarithmic growth rate as a function of scale and redshift. We estimate the predicted sensitivity of the proposed SDSS III (BOSS) survey and the proposed ADEPT mission and find that they will test structure growth in general relativity to the percent level.},

@article{Jain08,
	Abstract = {Modifications of general relativity provide an alternative explanation to dark energy for the observed acceleration of the Universe. Modified gravity theories have richer observational consequences for large-scale structures than conventional dark energy models, in that different observables are not described by a single growth factor even in the linear regime. We examine the relationships between perturbations in the metric potentials, density and velocity fields, and discuss strategies for measuring them using gravitational lensing, galaxy cluster abundances, galaxy clustering/dynamics, and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We show how a broad class of gravity theories can be tested by combining these probes. A robust way to interpret observations is by constraining two key functions: the ratio of the two metric potentials, and the ratio of the gravitational ``constant'' in the Poisson equation to Newton's constant. We also discuss quasilinear effects that carry signatures of gravity, such as through induced three-point correlations. Clustering of dark energy can mimic features of modified gravity theories and thus confuse the search for distinct signatures of such theories. It can produce pressure perturbations and anisotropic stresses, which break the equality between the two metric potentials even in general relativity. With these two extra degrees of freedom, can a clustered dark energy model mimic modified gravity models in all observational tests? We show with specific examples that observational constraints on both the metric potentials and density perturbations can in principle distinguish modifications of gravity from dark energy models. We compare our result with other recent studies that have slightly different assumptions (and apparently contradictory conclusions).},

@article{Guzzo08,
	Abstract = {Observations of distant supernovae indicate that the Universe is now in a phase of accelerated expansion the physical cause of which is a mystery. Formally, this requires the inclusion of a term acting as a negative pressure in the equations of cosmic expansion, accounting for about 75 per cent of the total energy density in the Universe. The simplest option for this `dark energy' corresponds to a `cosmological constant', perhaps related to the quantum vacuum energy. Physically viable alternatives invoke either the presence of a scalar field with an evolving equation of state, or extensions of general relativity involving higher-order curvature terms or extra dimensions. Although they produce similar expansion rates, different models predict measurable differences in the growth rate of large-scale structure with cosmic time. A fingerprint of this growth is provided by coherent galaxy motions, which introduce a radial anisotropy in the clustering pattern reconstructed by galaxy redshift surveys. Here we report a measurement of this effect at a redshift of 0.8. Using a new survey of more than 10,000 faint galaxies, we measure the anisotropy parameter beta = 0.70+/-0.26, which corresponds to a growth rate of structure at that time of f = 0.91+/-0.36. This is consistent with the standard cosmological-constant model with low matter density and flat geometry, although the error bars are still too large to distinguish among alternative origins for the accelerated expansion. The correct origin could be determined with a further factor-of-ten increase in the sampled volume at similar redshift.},

	Abstract = {The standard cosmology is based on general relativity (GR) and includes dark matter and dark energy and predicts a fixed relationship between the gravitational potentials responsible for gravitational lensing and the matter overdensity. Alternative theories of gravity often make different predictions. We propose a set of measurements which can test this relationship, thereby distinguishing between dark energy or matter models and models in which gravity differs from GR. Planned surveys will be able to measure EG, an observational quantity whose expectation value is equal to the ratio of the Laplacian of the Newtonian potentials to the peculiar velocity divergence, to percent accuracy. This will easily separate alternatives such as the cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant, Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati, TeVeS, and f(R) gravity.},

	Abstract = {The large-scale structure in the distribution of galaxies is thought to arise from the gravitational instability of small fluctuations in the initial density field of the Universe. A key test of this hypothesis is that forming superclusters of galaxies should generate a systematic infall of other galaxies. This would be evident in the pattern of recessional velocities, causing an anisotropy in the inferred spatial clustering of galaxies. Here we report a precise measurement of this clustering, using the redshifts of more than 141,000 galaxies from the two-degree-field (2dF) galaxy redshift survey. We determine the parameter beta = Omega0.6/<ITALIC>b</ITALIC> = 0.43 +/- 0.07, where Omega is the total mass-density parameter of the Universe and b is a measure of the `bias' of the luminous galaxies in the survey. (Bias is the difference between the clustering of visible galaxies and of the total mass, most of which is dark.) Combined with the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background, our results favour a low-density Universe with Omega ~ 0.3.},

	Abstract = {The linear growth rate is commonly defined through a simple deterministic relation between the velocity divergence and the matter overdensity in the linear regime. We introduce a formalism that extends this to a non-linear, stochastic relation between theta = nabla \cdot v({x},t)/aH and delta. This provides a new phenomenological approach that examines the conditional mean <theta|delta>, together with the fluctuations of theta around this mean. We measure these stochastic components using N-body simulations and find they are non-negative and increase with decreasing scale from ˜10 per cent at k < 0.2 h Mpc-1 to 25 per cent at k ˜ 0.45 h Mpc-1 at z = 0. Both the stochastic relation and non-linearity are more pronounced for haloes, M <= 5 × 1012 M&sun; h-1, compared to the dark matter at z = 0 and 1. Non-linear growth effects manifest themselves as a rotation of the mean <theta|delta> away from the linear theory prediction -fLTdelta, where fLT is the linear growth rate. This rotation increases with wavenumber, k, and we show that it can be well-described by second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT) for k < 0.1 h Mpc-1. The stochasticity in the theta-delta relation is not so simply described by 2LPT, and we discuss its impact on measurements of fLT from two-point statistics in redshift space. Given that the relationship between delta and theta is stochastic and non-linear, this will have implications for the interpretation and precision of fLT extracted using models which assume a linear, deterministic expression.},

	Abstract = {The existence of galaxy intrinsic clustering severely hampers the weak lensing reconstruction from cosmic magnification. In Paper I, we proposed a minimal variance estimator to overcome this problem. By utilizing the different dependences of cosmic magnification and galaxy intrinsic clustering on galaxy flux, we demonstrated that the otherwise overwhelming galaxy intrinsic clustering can be significantly suppressed such that lensing maps can be reconstructed with promising accuracy. This procedure relies heavily on the accuracy of determining the galaxy bias from the same data. Paper I adopts an iterative approach, which degrades towards high redshift. The current paper presents an alternative method, improving over Paper I. We prove that the measured galaxy clustering between flux bins allows for simultaneous determination of the lensing power spectrum and the flux dependence of galaxy bias, at this redshift bin. Compared to Paper I, the new approach is not only more straightforward but also more robust. It identifies an ambiguity in determining the galaxy bias and further discovers a mathematically robust way to suppress this ambiguity to negligible level (˜0.1 per cent). The accurately determined galaxy bias can then be applied to the minimal variance estimator proposed in Paper I to improve the lensing map-making. The gain at high redshift is significant. These maps can be used to measure other statistics, such as cluster finding and peak statistics. Furthermore, by including galaxy clustering measurement between different redshift bins, we can also determine the lensing cross power spectrum between these bins, up to a small and correctable multiplicative factor (˜0.2-1 per cent for different redshift bin couples).},

	Abstract = {The primordial velocity dispersion of dark matter is small compared to the velocities attained during structure formation. The initial density distribution is close to uniform, and it occupies an initial sheet in phase space that is single valued in velocity space. Because of gravitational forces, this 3D manifold evolves in phase space without ever tearing, conserving phase-space volume and preserving the connectivity of nearby points. N-body simulations already follow the motion of this sheet in phase space. This fact can be used to extract full fine-grained phase-space structure information from existing cosmological N-body simulations. Particles are considered as the vertices of an unstructured 3D mesh moving in 6D phase space. On this mesh, mass density and momentum are uniquely defined. We show how to obtain the space density of the fluid, detect caustics and count the number of streams as well as their individual contributions to any point in configuration space. We calculate the bulk velocity, local velocity dispersions and densities from the sheet - all without averaging over control volumes. This gives a wealth of new information about dark matter fluid flow which had previously been thought of as inaccessible to N-body simulations. We outline how this mapping may be used to create new accurate collisionless fluid simulation codes that may be able to overcome the sparse sampling and unphysical two-body effects that plague current N-body techniques.},

@article{Leclercq15,
	Abstract = {Recent application of the Bayesian algorithm BORG to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main sample galaxies resulted in the physical inference of the formation history of the observed large-scale structure from its origin to the present epoch. In this work, we use these inferences as inputs for a detailed probabilistic cosmic web-type analysis. To do so, we generate a large set of data-constrained realizations of the large-scale structure using a fast, fully non-linear gravitational model. We then perform a dynamic classification of the cosmic web into four distinct components (voids, sheets, filaments and clusters) on the basis of the tidal field. Our inference framework automatically and self-consistently propagates typical observational uncertainties to web-type classification. As a result, this study produces highly detailed and accurate cosmographic classification of large-scale structure elements in the SDSS volume. By also providing the history of these structure maps, the approach allows an analysis of the origin and growth of the early traces of the cosmic web present in the initial density field and of the evolution of global quantities such as the volume and mass filling fractions of different structures. For the problem of web-type classification, the results described in this work constitute the first connection between theory and observations at non-linear scales including a physical model of structure formation and the demonstrated capability of uncertainty quantification. A connection between cosmology and information theory using real data also naturally emerges from our probabilistic approach. Our results constitute quantitative chrono-cosmography of the complex web-like patterns underlying the observed galaxy distribution.},

@article{wangxin14,
	Abstract = {We investigate the nonlinear evolution of cosmic morphologies of the large-scale structure by examining the Lagrangian dynamics of various tensors of a cosmic fluid element, including the velocity gradient tensor, the Hessian matrix of the gravitational potential as well as the deformation tensor. Instead of the eigenvalue representation, the first two tensors, which associate with the "kinematic" and "dynamical" cosmic web classification algorithm respectively, are studied in a more convenient parameter space. These parameters are defined as the rotational invariant coefficients of the characteristic equation of the tensor. In the nonlinear local model (NLM) where the magnetic part of Weyl tensor vanishes, these invariants are fully capable of characterizing the dynamics. Unlike the Zeldovich approximation (ZA), where various morphologies do not change before approaching a one-dimensional singularity, the sheets in NLM are unstable for both overdense and underdense perturbations. While it has long been known that the coupling between tidal tensor and velocity shear would cause a filamentary final configuration of a collapsing region, we show that the underdense perturbation are more subtle, as the balance between the shear rate (tidal force) and the divergence (density) could lead to different morphologies. Interestingly, this instability also sets the basis for understanding some distinctions of the cosmic web identified dynamically and kinematically. We show that the sheets with negative density perturbation in the potential based algorithm would turn to filaments faster than in the kinematic method, which could explain the distorted dynamical filamentary structure observed in the simulation.},

	Abstract = {We study the alignment of dark matter haloes with the cosmic web characterized by the tidal and velocity shear fields. We focus on the alignment of their shape, angular momentum and peculiar velocities. We use a cosmological N-body simulation that allows us to study dark matter haloes spanning almost five orders of magnitude in mass (109-1014) h-1 M&sun; and spatial scales of (0.5-1.0) h-1 Mpc to define the cosmic web. The strongest alignment is measured for halo shape along the smallest tidal eigenvector, e.g. along filaments and walls, with a signal that gets stronger as the halo mass increases. In the case of the velocity shear field only massive haloes >1012 h-1 M&sun; tend to have their shapes aligned along the largest tidal eigenvector, i.e. perpendicular to filaments and walls. For the angular momentum we find alignment signals only for haloes more massive than 1012 h-1 M&sun; both in the tidal and velocity shear fields where the preferences is to be parallel to the middle eigenvector; perpendicular to filaments and parallel to walls. Finally, the peculiar velocities show a strong alignment along the smallest tidal eigenvector for all halo masses; haloes move along filaments and walls. The same alignment is present with the velocity shear, albeit weaker and only for haloes less massive than 1012 h-1 M&sun;. Our results show that the two different algorithms used to define the cosmic web describe different physical aspects of non-linear collapse and should be used in a complementary way to understand the cosmic web influence on galaxy evolution.},

The cross-sections of these filaments are typically partitioned into four quadrants with opposite vorticity sign, arising from multiple flows, originating from neighbouring walls. The spins of haloes embedded within these filaments are consistently aligned with this vorticity for any halo mass, with a stronger alignment for the most massive structures up to an excess of probability of 165 per cent. The global geometry of the flow within the cosmic web is therefore qualitatively consistent with a spin acquisition for smaller haloes induced by this large-scale coherence, as argued in Codis et al. In effect, secondary anisotropic infall (originating from the vortex-rich filament within which these lower-mass haloes form) dominates the angular momentum budget of these haloes. The transition mass from alignment to orthogonality is related to the size of a given multi-flow region with a given polarity. This transition may be reconciled with the standard tidal torque theory if the latter is augmented so as to account for the larger scale anisotropic environment of walls and filaments.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the velocity field is very important for modern cosmology: it gives insights to structure formation in general, and also its properties are crucial ingredients in modelling redshift-space distortions and in interpreting measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. Unfortunately, characterising the velocity field in cosmological N-body simulations is inherently complicated by two facts: i) The velocity field becomes manifestly multi-valued after shell-crossing and has discontinuities at caustics. This is due to the collisionless nature of dark matter. ii) N-body simulations sample the velocity field only at a set of discrete locations, with poor resolution in low-density regions. In this paper, we discuss how the associated problems can be circumvented by using a phase-space interpolation technique. This method provides extremely accurate estimates of the cosmic velocity fields and its derivatives, which can be properly defined without the need of the arbitrary "coarse-graining" procedure commonly used. We explore in detail the configuration-space properties of the cosmic velocity field on very large scales and in the highly nonlinear regime. In particular, we characterise the divergence and curl of the velocity field, present their one-point statistics, analyse the Fourier-space properties and provide fitting formulae for the velocity divergence bias relative to the non-linear matter power spectrum. We furthermore contrast some of the interesting differences in the velocity fields of warm and cold dark matter models. We anticipate that the high-precision measurements carried out here will help to understand in detail the dynamics of dark matter and the structures it forms.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of the large-scale distribution of matter in the universe is often characterized by the density field. Here we take a complimentary approach and characterize it using the cosmic velocity field, specifically the deformation of the velocity field. The deformation tensor is decomposed into its symmetric component (known as the `shear tensor') and its antisymmetric part (the `vorticity'). Using a high-resolution cosmological simulation, we examine the relative orientations of the shear and the vorticity as a function of spatial scale and redshift. The shear is found to be remarkably stable to the choice of scale, while the vorticity is found to quickly decay with increasing spatial scale or redshift. The vorticity emerges out of the linear regime randomly oriented with respect to the shear eigenvectors. Non-linear evolution drives the vorticity to lie within the plane defined by the eigenvector of the fastest collapse. Within that plane, the vorticity first gets aligned with the middle eigenvector and then it moves to be preferentially aligned with the third eigenvector, of slowest collapse. Finally, a scale of `non-linearity' to be used when calculating the properties of the non-linear deformation tensor at different redshifts is suggested.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the structure of the matter distribution in the Universe due to the action of the gravitational instability---the creation of the ``cosmic web''---is complicated by lack of direct analytic access to the complex nonlinear domain of structure formation. Here, we suggest and apply a novel tessellation method designed for cold dark matter (CDM) N-body cosmological simulations. The method is based on the fact that the initial CDM state can be described by a 3-dimensional manifold (in a 6-dimensional phase space) that remains continuous under evolution. Our technique uses the full phase space information and has no free parameters; it can be used to compute multistream and density fields, the main focus of this paper. Using a large-box LambdaCDM simulation we carry out a variety of illustrative initial analyses with the technique. These include studying the correlation between multistreaming and density, the identification of structures such as Zel'dovich pancakes and voids, and statistical measurements of quantities such as the volume fraction as a function of the number of streams---where we find a remarkable scaling relation. Cosmological implications are briefly discussed.},

@article{Novikov06,
	Abstract = {We discuss the skeleton as a probe of the filamentary structures of a two-dimensional random field. It can be defined for a smooth field as the ensemble of pairs of field lines departing from saddle points, initially aligned with the major axis of local curvature and connecting them to local maxima. This definition is thus non-local and makes analytical predictions difficult, so we propose a local approximation: the local skeleton is given by the set of points where the gradient is aligned with the local curvature major axis and where the second component of the local curvature is negative.  We perform a statistical analysis of the length of the total local skeleton, chosen for simplicity as the set of all points of space where the gradient is either parallel or orthogonal to the main curvature axis. In all our numerical experiments, which include Gaussian and various non-Gaussian realizations such as chi2 fields and Zel'dovich maps, the differential length f of the skeleton is found within a normalization factor to be very close to the probability distribution function (pdf) of the smoothed field, as expected and explicitly demonstrated in the Gaussian case where semi-analytical results are derived.  As a result of the special nature of the skeleton, the differences between f and the pdf are small but noticeable. We find in the Gaussian case that they increase with the coherence parameter 0 <=gamma<= 1 of the field:Here, is the total length of the skeleton and is the length of the skeleton in the excursion rho > sigmax where sigma is the variance of the density field. This result makes the skeleton an interesting alternative probe of non-Gaussianity. Our analyses furthermore assume that the total length of the skeleton is a free, adjustable parameter. This total length could in fact be used to constrain cosmological models, in cosmic microwave background maps but also in three-dimensional galaxy catalogues, where it estimates the total length of filaments in the Universe.  Making the link with other works, we also show how the skeleton can be used to study the dynamics of large-scale structure.},

	Abstract = {We use a 64 h-1 Mpc dark-matter-only cosmological simulation to examine the large-scale orientation of haloes and substructures with respect to the cosmic web. A web classification scheme based on the velocity shear tensor is used to assign to each halo in the simulation a web type: knot, filament, sheet or void. Using ˜106 haloes that span ˜3 orders of magnitude in mass, the orientation of the halo's spin and the orbital angular momentum of subhaloes with respect to the eigenvectors of the shear tensor is examined. We find that the orbital angular momentum of subhaloes tends to align with the intermediate eigenvector of the velocity shear tensor for all haloes in knots, filaments and sheets. This result indicates that the kinematics of substructures located deep within the virialized regions of a halo is determined by its infall which in turn is determined by the large-scale velocity shear, a surprising result given the virialized nature of haloes. The non-random nature of subhalo accretion is thus imprinted on the angular momentum measured at z= 0. We also find that the haloes' spin axis is aligned with the third eigenvector of the velocity shear tensor in filaments and sheets: the halo spin axis points along filaments and lies in the plane of cosmic sheets.},

	Abstract = {Using a series of high-resolution N-body simulations of the concordance cosmology we investigate how the formation histories, shapes and angular momenta of dark matter haloes depend on environment. We first present a classification scheme that allows us to distinguish between haloes in clusters, filaments, sheets and voids in the large-scale distribution of matter. This method (which goes beyond a simple measure of the local density) is based on a local-stability criterion for the orbits of test particles and closely relates to the Zel'dovich approximation. Applying this scheme to our simulations we then find that: (i) mass assembly histories and formation redshifts strongly depend on environment for haloes of mass M < M* (haloes of a given mass tend to be older in clusters and younger in voids) and are independent of it for larger masses (M* here indicates the typical mass scale which is entering the non-linear regime of perturbation growth); (ii) low-mass haloes in clusters are generally less spherical and more prolate than in other regions; (iii) low-mass haloes in clusters have a higher median spin than in filaments and present a more prominent fraction of rapidly spinning objects. We identify recent major mergers as a likely source of this effect. For all these relations, we provide accurate functional fits as a function of halo mass and environment. We also look for correlations between halo-spin directions and the large-scale structures: the strongest effect is seen in sheets where halo spins tend to lie within the plane of symmetry of the mass distribution. Finally, we measure the spatial autocorrelation of spin directions and the cross-correlation between the directions of intrinsic and orbital angular momenta of neighbouring haloes. While the first quantity is always very small, we find that spin-orbit correlations are rather strong especially for low-mass haloes in clusters and high-mass haloes in filaments.},

	Abstract = {In the standard model of cosmology, structure emerges out of a non-rotational flow and the angular momentum of collapsing halos is induced by tidal torques. The growth of angular momentum in the linear and quasi-linear phases is associated with a shear, curl-free, flow and it is well described within the linear framework of tidal torque theory (TTT). However, TTT ceases to be applicable as halos approach turnaround when their ambient flow field becomes rotational. Subsequently, halos become embedded in a vortical flow field and the growth of their angular momentum is affected by the vorticity of their ambient velocity field. Using a cosmological simulation, we have examined the importance of the curl of the velocity field in determining halo spin, finding a significant alignment between the two: the vorticity tends to be perpendicular to the axis of the fastest collapse of the velocity shear tensor (e 1). This is independent of halo masses and cosmic web environment. Our results agree with previous findings on the tendency of halo spin to be perpendicular to e 1, and of the spin of (simulated) halos and (observed) galaxies to be aligned with the large-scale structure. It follows that angular momentum growth proceeds in two distinct phases. First, the angular momentum emerges out of a shear, curl-free, potential flow, as described by TTT. In the second phase, in which halos approach virialization, the angular momentum emerges out of a vortical flow and halo spin becomes partially aligned with the vorticity of the ambient flow field.},

@article{Libeskind13a,
	Abstract = {The alignment of dark matter (DM) haloes and the surrounding large-scale structure (LSS) is examined in the context of the cosmic web. Halo spin, shape and the orbital angular momentum of subhaloes are investigated relative to the LSS using the eigenvectors of the velocity shear tensor evaluated on a grid with a scale of 1 Mpc h-1, deep within the non-linear regime. Knots, filaments, sheets and voids are associated with regions that are collapsing along 3, 2, 1 or 0 principal directions simultaneously. Each halo is tagged with a web classification (i.e. knot halo, filament halo, etc.) according to the nature of the collapse at the halo position. The full distribution of shear eigenvalues is found to be substantially different from that tagged to haloes, indicating that the observed velocity shear is significantly biased. We find that larger mass haloes live in regions where the shear is more isotropic, namely the expansion or collapse is more spherical. A correlation is found between the halo shape and the eigenvectors of the shear tensor, with the longest (shortest) axis of the halo shape being aligned with the slowest (fastest) collapsing eigenvector. This correlation is web independent, suggesting that the velocity shear is a fundamental tracer of the halo alignment. A similar result is found for the alignment of halo spin with the cosmic web. It has been shown that high-mass haloes exhibit a spin flip with respect to the LSS: we find that the mass at which this spin flip occurs is web dependent and not universal as suggested previously. Although weaker than haloes, subhalo orbits too exhibit an alignment with the LSS, providing a possible insight into the highly correlated corotation of the Milky Way's satellite system. The present study suggests that the velocity shear tensor constitutes the natural framework for studying the directional properties of the non-linear LSS and those of haloes and galaxies.},

@article{Aragon-Calvo07,
	Abstract = {Aims:We present here a new method, MMF, for automatically segmenting cosmic structure into its basic components: clusters, filaments, and walls. Importantly, the segmentation is scale independent, so all structures are identified without prejudice as to their size or shape. The method is ideally suited for extracting catalogues of clusters, walls, and filaments from samples of galaxies in redshift surveys or from particles in cosmological N-body simulations: it makes no prior assumptions about the scale or shape of the structures.  Methods: Our Multiscale Morphology Filter (MMF) method has been developed on the basis of visualization and feature extraction techniques in computer vision and medical research. The density or intensity field of the sample is smoothed over a range of scales. The smoothed signals are processed through a morphology response filter whose form is dictated by the particular morphological feature it seeks to extract, and depends on the local shape and spatial coherence of the intensity field. The morphology signal at each location is then defined to be the one with the maximum response across the full range of smoothing scales. The success of our method in identifying anisotropic features such as filaments and walls depends critically on the use of an optimally defined intensity field. This is accomplished by applying the DTFE reconstruction methodology to the sample particle or galaxy distribution.  Results: We have tested our MMF Filter against a set of heuristic models of weblike patterns such as are seen in the Megaparsec cosmic matter distribution. To test its effectiveness in the context of more realistic configurations we also present preliminary results from the MMF analysis of an N-body model. Comparison with alternative prescriptions for feature extraction shows that MMF is a remarkably strong structure finder},

	Abstract = {The large-scale structure of the Universe is characterized by a web-like structure made of voids, sheets, filaments and knots. The structure of this so-called cosmic web is dictated by the local velocity shear tensor. In particular, the local direction of a filament should be strongly aligned with hat{e}_3, the eigenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue of the tensor. That conjecture is tested here on the basis of a cosmological simulation. The cosmic web delineated by the halo distribution is probed by a marked point process with interactions (the Bisous model), detecting filaments directly from the halo distribution (P-web). The detected P-web filaments are found to be strongly aligned with the local hat{e}_3: the alignment is within 30$\,^{\circ}$ for ˜80 per cent of the elements. This indicates that large-scale filaments defined purely from the distribution of haloes carry more than just morphological information, although the Bisous model does not make any prior assumption on the underlying shear tensor. The P-web filaments are also compared to the structure revealed from the velocity shear tensor itself (V-web). In the densest regions, the P- and V-web filaments overlap well (90 per cent), whereas in lower density regions, the P-web filaments preferentially mark sheets in the V-web.},

A given point is classified to be either a void, sheet, filament or a knot according to the number of eigenvalues above a certain threshold, 0, 1, 2 or 3, respectively. The threshold is treated as a free parameter that defines the web. The algorithm has been applied to a dark matter only simulation of a box of side length 64 h-1 Mpc and N = 10243 particles within the framework of the 5-year Wilkinson and Microwave Anisotropy Probe/Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) model. The resulting velocity-based cosmic web resolves structures down to ≲0.1 h-1 Mpc scales, as opposed to the ≈1 h-1 Mpc scale of the tidal-based web. The underdense regions are made of extended voids bisected by planar sheets, whose density is also below the mean. The overdense regions are vastly dominated by the linear filaments and knots. The resolution achieved by the velocity-based cosmic web provides a platform for studying the formation of haloes and galaxies within the framework of the cosmic web.},

@article{Forero-Romero09,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new dynamical classification of the cosmic web. Each point in space is classified in one of four possible web types: voids, sheets, filaments and knots. The classification is based on the evaluation of the deformation tensor (i.e. the Hessian of the gravitational potential) on a grid. The classification is based on counting the number of eigenvalues above a certain threshold, lambdath, at each grid point, where the case of zero, one, two or three such eigenvalues corresponds to void, sheet, filament or a knot grid point. The collection of neighbouring grid points, friends of friends, of the same web type constitutes voids, sheets, filaments and knots as extended web objects.  A simple dynamical consideration of the emergence of the web suggests that the threshold should not be null, as in previous implementations of the algorithm. A detailed dynamical analysis would have found different threshold values for the collapse of sheets, filaments and knots. Short of such an analysis a phenomenological approach has been opted for, looking for a single threshold to be determined by analysing numerical simulations.  Our cosmic web classification has been applied and tested against a suite of large (dark matter only) cosmological N-body simulations. In particular, the dependence of the volume and mass filling fractions on lambdath and on the resolution has been calculated for the four web types. We also study the percolation properties of voids and filaments.  Our main findings are as follows. (i) Already at lambdath = 0.1 the resulting web classification reproduces the visual impression of the cosmic web. (ii) Between 0.2 <~ lambdath <~ 0.4, a system of percolated voids coexists with a net of interconnected filaments. This suggests a reasonable choice for lambdath as the parameter that defines the cosmic web. (iii) The dynamical nature of the suggested classification provides a robust framework for incorporating environmental information into galaxy formation models, and in particular to semi-analytical models.},

	Abstract = {Perturbation theory for dark matter clustering has received a lot of attention in recent years, but its convergence properties remain poorly justified and there is no successful model that works both for correlation function and for power spectrum. Here we present Halo Zeldovich approach combined with perturbation theory (HZPT), in which we use standard perturbation theory at one loop order (SPT) at very low $k$, and connect it to a version of the halo model, for which we adopt the Zeldovich approximation plus a Pade expansion of a compensated one halo term. This low $k$ matching allows us to determine the one halo term amplitude and redshift evolution, both of which are in an excellent agreement with simulations, and approximately agree with the expected value from the halo model. Our Pade expansion approach of the one halo term added to Zeldovich approximation identifies two typical halo scales averaged over the halo mass function, the halo radius scale of order of 1Mpc/h, and the halo mass compensation scale of order 26Mpc/h. The model gives better than one percent accurate predictions for the correlation function above 5Mpc/h at all redshifts, without any free parameters. With three fitted Pade expansion coefficients the agreement in power spectrum is good to a percent up to $k \sim 1$h/Mpc, which can be improved to arbitrary $k$ by adding higher order terms in Pade expansion.},

@article{More11,
	Abstract = {The friends-of-friends algorithm (hereafter FOF) is a percolation algorithm which is routinely used to identify dark matter halos from N-body simulations. We use results from percolation theory to show that the boundary of FOF halos does not correspond to a single density threshold but to a range of densities close to a critical value that depends upon the linking length parameter, b. We show that for the commonly used choice of b = 0.2, this critical density is equal to 81.62 times the mean matter density. Consequently, halos identified by the FOF algorithm enclose an average overdensity which depends on their density profile (concentration) and therefore changes with halo mass, contrary to the popular belief that the average overdensity is ~180. We derive an analytical expression for the overdensity as a function of the linking length parameter b and the concentration of the halo. Results of tests carried out using simulated and actual FOF halos identified in cosmological simulations show excellent agreement with our analytical prediction. We also find that the mass of the halo that the FOF algorithm selects crucially depends upon mass resolution. We find a percolation-theory-motivated formula that is able to accurately correct for the dependence on number of particles for the mock realizations of spherical and triaxial Navarro-Frenk-White halos. However, we show that this correction breaks down when applied to the real cosmological FOF halos due to the presence of substructures. Given that abundance of substructure depends on redshift and cosmology, we expect that the resolution effects due to substructure on the FOF mass and halo mass function will also depend on redshift and cosmology and will be difficult to correct for in general. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the universality of the mass function.},

@article{van-Daalen15,
	Abstract = {Halo-based models have been successful in predicting the clustering of matter. However, the validity of the postulate that the clustering is fully determined by matter inside haloes remains largely untested, and it is not clear a priori whether non-virialised matter might contribute significantly to the non-linear clustering signal. Here, we investigate the contribution of haloes to the matter power spectrum as a function of both scale and halo mass by combining a set of cosmological N-body simulations to calculate the contributions of different spherical overdensity regions, Friends-of-Friends (FoF) groups and matter outside haloes to the power spectrum. We find that matter inside spherical overdensity regions of size R200,mean cannot account for all power for 1<k<100 h/Mpc, regardless of the minimum halo mass. At most, it accounts for 95% of the power (k>20 h/Mpc). For 2<k<10 h/Mpc, haloes with mass M200,mean<10^11 Msun/h contribute negligibly to the power spectrum, and our results appear to be converged with decreasing halo mass. When haloes are taken to be regions of size R200,crit, the amount of power unaccounted for is larger on all scales. Accounting also for matter inside FoF groups but outside R200,mean increases the contribution of halo matter on most scales probed here by 5-15%. Matter inside FoF groups with M200,mean>10^9 Msun/h accounts for essentially all power for 3<k<100 h/Mpc. We therefore expect halo models that ignore the contribution of matter outside R200,mean to overestimate the contribution of haloes of any mass to the power on small scales (k>1 h/Mpc).},

@article{Pace15,
	Abstract = {In this work we study the relevance of the cosmic web and substructures on the matter and lensing power spectra measured from halo mock catalogues extracted from the N-body simulations. Since N-body simulations are computationally expensive, it is common to use faster methods that approximate the dark matter field as a set of halos. In this approximation, we replace mass concentrations in N-body simulations by a spherically symmetric Navarro-Frenk-White halo density profile. We also consider the full mass field as the sum of two distinct fields: dark matter halos ($M>9\times 10^{12}~M_{\odot}$/h) and particles not included into halos. Mock halos reproduce well the matter power spectrum, but underestimate the lensing power spectrum on large and small scales. For sources at $z_{\rm s}=1$ the lensing power spectrum is underestimated by up to 40% at $\ell\approx 10^4$ with respect to the simulated halos. The large scale effect can be alleviated by combining the mock catalogue with the dark matter distribution outside the halos. In addition, to evaluate the contribution of substructures we have smeared out the intra-halo substructures in a N-body simulation while keeping the halo density profiles unchanged. For the matter power spectrum the effect of this smoothing is only of the order of 5%, but for lensing substructures are much more important: for $\ell\approx 10^4$ the internal structures contribute 30% of the total spectrum. These findings have important implications in the way mock catalogues have to be created, suggesting that some approximate methods currently used for galaxy surveys will be inadequate for future weak lensing surveys.},

@article{Eke01,
	Abstract = {High-resolution N-body simulations are used to examine the power spectrum dependence of the concentration of galaxy-sized dark matter halos. It is found that dark halo concentrations depend on the amplitude of mass fluctuations as well as on the ratio of power between small and virial mass scales. This finding is consistent with the original results of Navarro, Frenk, and White (NFW) and allows their model to be extended to include power spectra substantially different from cold dark matter (CDM). In particular, the single-parameter model presented here fits the concentration dependence on halo mass for truncated power spectra, such as those expected in the warm dark matter scenario, and predicts a stronger redshift dependence for the concentration of CDM halos than proposed by NFW. The latter conclusion confirms recent suggestions by Bullock and coworkers, although this new modeling differs from theirs in detail. These findings imply that observational limits on the concentration, such as those provided by estimates of the dark matter content within individual galaxies, may be used to constrain the amplitude of mass fluctuations on galactic and subgalactic scales. The constraints on LambdaCDM models posed by the dark mass within the solar circle in the Milky Way and by the zero point of the Tully-Fisher relation are revisited, with the result that neither data set is clearly incompatible with the ``concordance'' (Omega0=0.3, Lambda0=0.7, sigma8=0.9) LambdaCDM cosmogony. This conclusion differs from that reached recently by Navarro and Steinmetz, a disagreement that can be traced to inconsistencies in the normalization of the LambdaCDM power spectrum used in that work.},

	Abstract = {We use a combination of three large N-body simulations to investigate the dependence of dark matter halo concentrations on halo mass and redshift in the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe year 5 (WMAP5) cosmology. The median relation between concentration and mass is adequately described by a power law for halo masses in the range 1011-1015h-1Msolar and redshifts z < 2, regardless of whether the halo density profiles are fitted using Navarro, Frenk & White or Einasto profiles. Compared with recent analyses of the Millennium Simulation, which uses a value of sigma8 that is higher than allowed by WMAP5, z = 0 halo concentrations are reduced by factors ranging from 23 per cent at 1011h-1Msolar to 16 per cent at 1014h-1Msolar. The predicted concentrations are much lower than inferred from X-ray observations of groups and clusters.},

@article{gaoliang08,
	Abstract = {We use two very large cosmological simulations to study how the density profiles of relaxed Lambda cold dark matter dark haloes depend on redshift and on halo mass. We confirm that these profiles deviate slightly but systematically from the NFW form and are better approximated by the empirical formula, d logrho/d logr ~ ralpha, first used by Einasto to fit star counts in the Milky Way. The best-fitting value of the additional shape parameter, alpha, increases gradually with mass, from alpha ~ 0.16 for present-day galaxy haloes to alpha ~ 0.3 for the rarest and most massive clusters. Halo concentrations depend only weakly on mass at z = 0, and this dependence weakens further at earlier times. At z ~ 3 the average concentration of relaxed haloes does not vary appreciably over the mass range accessible to our simulations (M >~ 3 × 1011h-1Msolar). Furthermore, in our biggest simulation, the average concentration of the most massive, relaxed haloes is constant at <c200> ~ 3.5-4 for 0 <= z <= 3. These results agree well with those of Zhao et al. and support the idea that halo densities reflect the density of the universe at the time they formed, as proposed by Navarro, Frenk & White. With their original parameters, the NFW prescription overpredicts halo concentrations at high redshift. This shortcoming can be reduced by modifying the definition of halo formation time, although the evolution of the concentrations of Milky Way mass haloes is still not reproduced well. In contrast, the much-used revisions of the NFW prescription by Bullock et al. and Eke, Navarro & Steinmetz predict a steeper drop in concentration at the highest masses and stronger evolution with redshift than are compatible with our numerical data. Modifying the parameters of these models can reduce the discrepancy at high masses, but the overly rapid redshift evolution remains. These results have important implications for currently planned surveys of distant clusters.},

@article{Maccio08,
	Abstract = {We investigate the effects of changes in the cosmological parameters between the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 1st, 3rd and 5th year results on the structure of dark matter haloes. We use a set of simulations that cover five decades in halo mass ranging from the scales of dwarf galaxies (Vc ~ 30 km s-1) to clusters of galaxies (Vc ~ 1000 km s-1). We find that the concentration mass relation is a power law in all three cosmologies. However, the slope is shallower and the zero-point is lower moving from WMAP1 to WMAP5 to WMAP3. For haloes of mass logM200/[h-1Msolar] = 10, 12 and 14 the differences in the concentration parameter between WMAP1 and WMAP3 are a factor of 1.55, 1.41 and 1.29, respectively. As we show, this brings the central densities of dark matter haloes in good agreement with the central densities of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies inferred from their rotation curves, for both the WMAP3 and WMAP5 cosmologies. We also show that none of the existing toy models for the concentration-mass relation can reproduce our simulation results over the entire range of masses probed. In particular, the model of Bullock et al. fails at the higher mass end (M >~ 1013h-1Msolar), while the NFW model of Navarro, Frenk and White fails dramatically at the low-mass end (M <~ 1012h-1Msolar). We present a new model, based on a simple modification of that of Bullock et al., which reproduces the concentration-mass relations in our simulations over the entire range of masses probed (1010 <~ M <~ 1015h-1Msolar). Haloes in the WMAP3 cosmology (at a fixed mass) are more flatted compared to the WMAP1 cosmology, with a medium to long axis ration reduced by ~10 per cent. Finally, we show that the distribution of halo spin parameters is the same for all three cosmologies.},

We study the mass and redshift dependence of the concentration, shape and spin parameter in N-body simulations spanning masses from 1010 to 1015 h-1 M&sun; and redshifts from 0 to 2. We present a series of fitting formulae that accurately describe the time evolution of the concentration-mass (cvir-Mvir) relation since z= 2. Using arguments based on the spherical collapse model, we study the behaviour of the scalelength of the density profile during the assembly history of haloes, obtaining physical insights into the origin of the observed time evolution of the cvir-Mvir relation. We also investigate the evolution with redshift of dark matter halo shape and its dependence on mass. Within the studied redshift range, the relation between the halo shape and mass can be well fitted by a redshift-dependent power law. Finally we show that although for z= 0 the spin parameter is practically mass independent, at increasing redshift it shows an increasing correlation with mass.},

	Abstract = {We study the concentration of dark matter haloes and its evolution in N-body simulations of the standard Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) cosmology. The results presented in this paper are based on four large N-body simulations with ˜10 billion particles each: the Millennium-I and -II, Bolshoi and MultiDark simulations. The MultiDark (or BigBolshoi) simulation is introduced in this paper. This suite of simulations with high mass resolution over a large volume allows us to compute with unprecedented accuracy the concentration over a large range of scales (about six orders of magnitude in mass), which constitutes the state of the art of our current knowledge on this basic property of dark matter haloes in the LambdaCDM cosmology. We find that there is consistency among the different simulation data sets, despite the different codes, numerical algorithms and halo/subhalo finders used in our analysis. We confirm a novel feature for halo concentrations at high redshifts: a flattening and upturn with increasing mass. The concentration c(M, z) as a function of mass and the redshift and for different cosmological parameters shows a remarkably complex pattern. However, when expressed in terms of the linear rms fluctuation of the density field sigma(M, z), the halo concentration c(sigma) shows a nearly universal simple U-shaped behaviour with a minimum at a well-defined scale at sigma˜ 0.71. Yet, some small dependences with redshift and cosmology still remain. At the high-mass end (sigma < 1), the median halo kinematic profiles show large signatures of infall and highly radial orbits. This c-sigma(M, z) relation can be accurately parametrized and provides an analytical model for the dependence of concentration on halo mass. When applied to galaxy clusters, our estimates of concentrations are substantially larger - by a factor up to 1.5 - than previous results from smaller simulations, and are in much better agreement with results of observations.},

@article{Bhattacharya13,
	Abstract = {Dark-matter-dominated cluster-scale halos act as an important cosmological probe and provide a key testing ground for structure formation theory. Focusing on their mass profiles, we have carried out (gravity-only) simulations of the concordance LambdaCDM cosmology, covering a mass range of 2 × 1012 to 2 × 1015 h -1 M &sun; and a redshift range of z = 0-2, while satisfying the associated requirements of resolution and statistical control. When fitting to the Navarro-Frenk-White profile, our concentration-mass (c-M) relation differs in normalization and shape in comparison to previous studies that have limited statistics in the upper end of the mass range. We show that the flattening of the c-M relation with redshift is naturally expressed if c is viewed as a function of the peak height parameter, nu. Unlike the c-M relation, the slope of the c-nu relation is effectively constant over the redshift range z = 0-2, while the amplitude varies by ~30% for massive clusters. This relation is, however, not universal: using a simulation suite covering the allowed wCDM parameter space, we show that the c-nu relation varies by about $\pm$20% as cosmological parameters are varied. At fixed mass, the c(M) distribution is well fit by a Gaussian with sigma c /langcrang ~= 1/3, independent of the radius at which the concentration is defined, the halo dynamical state, and the underlying cosmology. We compare the LambdaCDM predictions with observations of halo concentrations from strong lensing, weak lensing, galaxy kinematics, and X-ray data, finding good agreement for massive clusters (M vir > 4 × 1014 h -1 M &sun;), but with some disagreements at lower masses. Because of uncertainty in observational systematics and modeling of baryonic physics, the significance of these discrepancies remains unclear.},

@article{Ludlow14,
	Abstract = {We use the Millennium Simulation series to investigate the mass and redshift dependence of the concentration of equilibrium cold dark matter (CDM) haloes. We extend earlier work on the relation between halo mass profiles and assembly histories to show how the latter may be used to predict concentrations for haloes of all masses and at any redshift. Our results clarify the link between concentration and the `collapse redshift' of a halo as well as why concentration depends on mass and redshift solely through the dimensionless `peak height' mass parameter, nu(M, z) = deltacrit(z)/sigma(M, z). We combine these results with analytic mass accretion histories to extrapolate the c(M, z) relations to mass regimes difficult to reach through direct simulation. Our model predicts that, at given z, c(M) should deviate systematically from a simple power law at high masses, where concentrations approach a constant value, and at low masses, where concentrations are substantially lower than expected from extrapolating published empirical fits. This correction may reduce the expected self-annihilation boost factor from substructure by about one order of magnitude. The model also reproduces the c(M, z) dependence on cosmological parameters reported in earlier work and thus provides a simple and robust account of the relation between cosmology and the mass-concentration-redshift relation of CDM haloes.},

	Abstract = {A set of new mathematical results on the theory of Gaussian random fields is presented, and the application of such calculations in cosmology to treat questions of structure formation from small-amplitude initial density fluctuations is addressed. The point process equation is discussed, giving the general formula for the average number density of peaks. The problem of the proper conditional probability constraints appropriate to maxima are examined using a one-dimensional illustration. The average density of maxima of a general three-dimensional Gaussian field is calculated as a function of heights of the maxima, and the average density of 'upcrossing' points on density contour surfaces is computed. The number density of peaks subject to the constraint that the large-scale density field be fixed is determined and used to discuss the segregation of high peaks from the underlying mass distribution. The machinery to calculate n-point peak-peak correlation functions is determined, as are the shapes of the profiles about maxima.},

@article{BigBOSS11,
	Abstract = {BigBOSS is a Stage IV ground-based dark energy experiment to study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the growth of structure with a wide-area galaxy and quasar redshift survey over 14,000 square degrees. It has been conditionally accepted by NOAO in response to a call for major new instrumentation and a high-impact science program for the 4-m Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak. The BigBOSS instrument is a robotically-actuated, fiber-fed spectrograph capable of taking 5000 simultaneous spectra over a wavelength range from 340 nm to 1060 nm, with a resolution R = 3000-4800. Using data from imaging surveys that are already underway, spectroscopic targets are selected that trace the underlying dark matter distribution. In particular, targets include luminous red galaxies (LRGs) up to z = 1.0, extending the BOSS LRG survey in both redshift and survey area. To probe the universe out to even higher redshift, BigBOSS will target bright [OII] emission line galaxies (ELGs) up to z = 1.7. In total, 20 million galaxy redshifts are obtained to measure the BAO feature, trace the matter power spectrum at smaller scales, and detect redshift space distortions. BigBOSS will provide additional constraints on early dark energy and on the curvature of the universe by measuring the Ly-alpha forest in the spectra of over 600,000 2.2 < z < 3.5 quasars. BigBOSS galaxy BAO measurements combined with an analysis of the broadband power, including the Ly-alpha forest in BigBOSS quasar spectra, achieves a FOM of 395 with Planck plus Stage III priors. This FOM is based on conservative assumptions for the analysis of broad band power (kmax = 0.15), and could grow to over 600 if current work allows us to push the analysis to higher wave numbers (kmax = 0.3). BigBOSS will also place constraints on theories of modified gravity and inflation, and will measure the sum of neutrino masses to 0.024 eV accuracy.},

@article{Schaap00,
	Abstract = {Here we introduce the Delaunay Density Estimator Method. Its purpose is rendering a fully volume-covering reconstruction of a density field from a set of discrete data points sampling this field. Reconstructing density or intensity fields from a set of irregularly sampled data is a recurring key issue in operations on astronomical data sets, both in an observational context as well as in the context of numerical simulations. Our technique is based upon the stochastic geometric concept of the Delaunay tessellation generated by the point set. We shortly describe the method, and illustrate its virtues by means of an application to an N-body simulation of cosmic structure formation. The presented technique is a fully adaptive method: automatically it probes high density regions at maximum possible resolution, while low density regions are recovered as moderately varying regions devoid of the often irritating shot-noise effects. Of equal importance is its capability to sharply and undilutedly recover anisotropic density features like filaments and walls. The prominence of such features at a range of resolution levels within a hierarchical clustering scenario as the example of the standard CDM scenario is shown to be impressively recovered by our scheme.},

	Abstract = {Analytical studies based on perturbative theory have shown that the moments of the probability distribution function (PDF) of the local smoothed velocity divergence are expected to have a very specific dependence on the density parameter Omega in the quasi-linear regime. This dependence is particularly interesting as it does not involve the possible bias between the galaxy spatial distribution and the underlying mass distribution. This implies a new and promising method for determining a bias-independent value of Omega based on a reliable determination of the velocity divergence PDF. In this paper we study the Omega dependence of the velocity divergence PDF and its first moments in a set of N-body simulations, using the so-called Voronoi and Delaunay methods. We show that this dependence is in agreement with the theoretical prediction, even while the number density of velocity field tracers has been diluted to a value comparable to that available in current galaxy catalogues. In addition, we demonstrate that a sufficiently reliable determination of these statistical quantities is also possible when the measurement of the galaxy peculiar velocities is restricted to the one component along the line of sight. Under ideal, noise-free circumstances we can successfully discriminate between low and high Omega.},

	Abstract = {Measuring the volume weighted velocity power spectrum suffers from a severe systematic error due to imperfect sampling of the velocity field from the inhomogeneous distribution of dark matter particles/halos in simulations or galaxies with velocity measurement. This "sampling artifact" depends on both the mean particle number density n¯P and the intrinsic large scale structure (LSS) fluctuation in the particle distribution. (1) We report robust detection of this sampling artifact in N -body simulations. It causes ˜12 % underestimation of the velocity power spectrum at k =0.1 h /Mpc for samples with n¯ P=6 ×10-3 (Mpc /h )-3 . This systematic underestimation increases with decreasing n¯P and increasing k . Its dependence on the intrinsic LSS fluctuations is also robustly detected. (2) All of these findings are expected based upon our theoretical modeling in paper I [P. Zhang, Y. Zheng, and Y. Jing, Sampling artifact in volume weighted velocity measurement. I. Theoretical modeling, arXiv:1405.7125.]. In particular, the leading order theoretical approximation agrees quantitatively well with the simulation result for n¯ P≳6 ×10-4 (Mpc /h )-3 . Furthermore, we provide an ansatz to take high order terms into account. It improves the model accuracy to ≲1 % at k ≲0.1 h /Mpc over 3 orders of magnitude in n¯P and over typical LSS clustering from z =0 to z =2 . (3) The sampling artifact is determined by the deflection D field, which is straightforwardly available in both simulations and data of galaxy velocity. Hence the sampling artifact in the velocity power spectrum measurement can be self-calibrated within our framework. By applying such self-calibration in simulations, it is promising to determine the real large scale velocity bias of 1013M&sun; halos with ˜1 % accuracy, and that of lower mass halos with better accuracy. (4) In contrast to suppressing the velocity power spectrum at large scale, the sampling artifact causes an overestimation of the velocity dispersion. We prove that a correlation between the signal field (v ) and the sampling field (D ) is a major cause. This complexity, among other issues, is carefully investigated to further improve understanding of the sampling artifact.},

@article{zhangpj15,
	Abstract = {Cosmology based on large scale peculiar velocity prefers volume weighted velocity statistics. However, measuring the volume weighted velocity statistics from inhomogeneously distributed galaxies (simulation particles/halos) suffers from an inevitable and significant sampling artifact. We study this sampling artifact in the velocity power spectrum measured by the nearest particle velocity assignment method by Zheng et al., [Phys. Rev. D 88, 103510 (2013).]. We derive the analytical expression of leading and higher order terms. We find that the sampling artifact suppresses the z =0 E -mode velocity power spectrum by ˜10 % at k =0.1 h /Mpc , for samples with number density 10-3 (Mpc /h )-3 . This suppression becomes larger for larger k and for sparser samples. We argue that this source of systematic errors in peculiar velocity cosmology, albeit severe, can be self-calibrated in the framework of our theoretical modelling. We also work out the sampling artifact in the density-velocity cross power spectrum measurement. A more robust evaluation of related statistics through simulations will be presented in a companion paper by Zheng et al., [Sampling artifact in volume weighted velocity measurement. II. Detection in simulations and comparison with theoretical modelling, arXiv:1409.6809.]. We also argue that similar sampling artifact exists in other velocity assignment methods and hence must be carefully corrected to avoid systematic bias in peculiar velocity cosmology.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of dark matter halo shapes, studying how the distributions of ellipticity, prolateness and axial ratios evolve as a function of time and mass. With this purpose in mind, we analysed the results of three cosmological simulations, running an ellipsoidal halo finder to measure triaxial halo shapes. The simulations have different scales, mass limits and cosmological parameters, which allows us to ensure a good resolution and statistics in a wide mass range, and to investigate the dependence of halo properties on the cosmological model. We confirm the tendency of haloes to be prolate at all times, even if they become more triaxial going to higher redshifts. Regarding the dependence on mass, more massive haloes are also less spherical at all redshifts, since they are the most recent forming systems and so still retain memory of their original shape at the moment of collapse. We then propose a rescaling of the shape-mass relations, using the variable nu = deltac/sigma to represent the mass, which absorbs the dependence on both cosmology and time, allowing us to find universal relations between halo masses and shape parameters (ellipticity, prolateness and the axial ratios) which hold at any redshift. This may be very useful to determine prior distributions of halo shapes for observational studies.},

Using a polynomially fitted non-linear power spectrum P(k) obtained from N-body simulations that can resolve haloes with a mass of M ˜ 105 M&sun;, or structures with a comoving wavenumber of k ˜ 3 × 102 h Mpc-1, we find that the ratio of magnification perturbation due to intervening haloes to that of a primary lens is typically ˜10 per cent and the predicted values agree well with the estimated values for six observed QSO-galaxy lens systems with quadruple images in the mid-infrared band without considering the effects of substructures inside a primary lens. We also find that the estimated amplitudes of convergence perturbation for the six lenses increase with the source redshift as predicted by theoretical models. Using an extrapolated matter power spectrum, we demonstrate that small haloes or subhaloes in the line of sight with a mass of M = 103-107 M&sun;, or structures with a comoving wavenumber of k = 3 × 102-104 h Mpc-1, can significantly affect the magnification ratios of the lensed images. Flux-ratio anomalies in QSO-galaxy strong lens systems offer us a unique probe into the clustering property of minihaloes with a mass of M < 106 M&sun;.},

	Abstract = {Near-future cosmological observations targeted at investigations of dark energy pose stringent requirements on the accuracy of theoretical predictions for the nonlinear clustering of matter. Currently, N-body simulations comprise the only viable approach to this problem. In this paper, we study various sources of computational error and methods to control them. By applying our methodology to a large suite of cosmological simulations we show that results for the (gravity-only) nonlinear matter power spectrum can be obtained at 1% accuracy out to k ~ 1 h Mpc-1. The key components of these high accuracy simulations are precise initial conditions, very large simulation volumes, sufficient mass resolution, and accurate time stepping. This paper is the first in a series of three; the final aim is a high-accuracy prediction scheme for the nonlinear matter power spectrum that improves current fitting formulae by an order of magnitude.},

	Abstract = {A new cosmic shear analysis pipeline SUNGLASS (Simulated UNiverses for Gravitational Lensing Analysis and Shear Surveys) is introduced. SUNGLASS is a pipeline that rapidly generates simulated universes for weak-lensing and cosmic shear analysis. The pipeline forms suites of cosmological N-body simulations and performs tomographic cosmic shear analysis using line-of-sight integration through these simulations while saving the particle lightcone information. Galaxy shear and convergence catalogues with realistic 3D galaxy redshift distributions are produced for the purposes of testing weak-lensing analysis techniques and generating covariance matrices for data analysis and cosmological parameter estimation. We present a suite of fast medium-resolution simulations with shear and convergence maps for a generic 100 deg2 survey out to a redshift of z= 1.5, with angular power spectra agreeing with the theory to better than a few per cent accuracy up to l= 103 for all source redshifts up to z= 1.5 and wavenumbers up to l= 2000 for the source redshifts z>= 1.1. At higher wavenumbers, there is a failure of the theoretical lensing power spectrum reflecting the known discrepancy of the Smith et al. fitting formula at high physical wavenumbers. A two-parameter Gaussian likelihood analysis of sigma8 and Omegam is also performed on the suite of simulations, demonstrating that the cosmological parameters are recovered from the simulations and the covariance matrices are stable for data analysis. We find that any residual bias in our calculation is below our uncertainty within the 1sigma confidence limits. The SUNGLASS pipeline should be an invaluable tool in weak-lensing analysis.},

@article{Casarini12,
	Abstract = {Context. Forthcoming experiments will enable us to determine tomographic shear spectra at a high precision level. Most predictions about them have until now been based on algorithms yielding the expected linear and non-linear spectrum of density fluctuations. Even when simulations have been used, so-called Halofit predictions on fairly large scales have been needed.  Aims: We wish to go beyond this limitation.  Methods: We perform N-body and hydrodynamical simulations within a sufficiently large cosmological volume to allow a direct connection between simulations and linear spectra. While covering large length-scales, the simulation resolution is good enough to allow us to explore the high-l harmonics of the cosmic shear (up to l ~ 50 000), well into the domain where baryon physics becomes important. We then compare shear spectra in the absence and in presence of various kinds of baryon physics, such as radiative cooling, star formation, and supernova feedback in the form of galactic winds.  Results: We distinguish several typical properties of matter fluctuation spectra in the different simulations and test their impact on shear spectra.  Conclusions: We compare our outputs with those obtainable using approximate expressions for non-linear spectra, and identify substantial discrepancies even between our results and those of purely N-body results. Our simulations and the treatment of their outputs however enable us, for the first time, to obtain shear results that are fully independent of any approximate expression, also in the high-l range, where we need to incorporate a non-linear power spectrum of density perturbations and the effects of baryon physics. This will allow us to fully exploit the cosmological information contained in future high-sensitivity cosmic shear surveys, exploring the physics of cosmic shears via weak lensing measurements.},

	Abstract = {Gravitational lensing surveys have now become large and precise enough that the interpretation of the lensing signal has to take into account an increasing number of theoretical limitations and observational biases. Because the lensing signal is strongest at small angular scales, only numerical simulations can reproduce faithfully the non-linear dynamics and secondary effects at play. This paper is the first of a series in which all gravitational lensing corrections known so far will be implemented in the same set of simulations, using realistic mock catalogues and non-Gaussian statistics. In this first paper, we present the TCS simulation suite and we compute basic statistics, such as the second- and third-order convergence and shear correlation functions. These simple tests set the range of validity of our simulations, which are resolving most of the signals at the subarcminute level (or l ˜ 104). We also compute the non-Gaussian covariance matrix of several statistical estimators, including many that are used in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). From the same realizations, we construct halo catalogues, computing a series of properties that are required by most galaxy population algorithms.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We investigate the building of unified models that can predict the matter-density power spectrum and the two-point correlation function from very large to small scales, being consistent with perturbation theory at low k and with halo models at high k.  Methods: We use a Lagrangian framework to re-interpret the halo model and to decompose the power spectrum into "2-halo" and "1-halo" contributions, related to "perturbative" and "non-perturbative" terms. We describe a simple implementation of this model and present a detailed comparison with numerical simulations, from k ~ 0.02 up to 100 h Mpc-1, and from x ~ 0.02 up to 150 h-1 Mpc.  Results: We show that the 1-halo contribution contains a counterterm that ensures a k2 tail at low k and this contribution is important not to spoil the predictions on the scales probed by baryon acoustic oscillations, k ~ 0.02 to 0.3 h Mpc-1. On the other hand, we show that standard perturbation theory is inadequate for the 2-halo contribution, because higher order terms grow too fast at high k, so that resummation schemes must be used. Moreover, we explain why such a model, which is based on the combination of perturbation theories and halo models, remains consistent with standard perturbation theory up to the order of the resummation scheme. We describe a simple implementation, based on a 1-loop "direct steepest-descent" resummation for the 2-halo contribution that allows fast numerical computations, and we check that we obtain a good match to simulations at low and high k. We also study the dependence of such predictions on the details of the underlying model, such as the choice of the perturbative resummation scheme or the properties of halo profiles. Our simple implementation already fares better than both standard 1-loop perturbation theory on large scales and simple fits to the power spectrum at high k, with a typical accuracy of 1% on large scales and 10% on small scales. We obtain similar results for the two-point correlation function. However, there remains room for improvement on the transition scale between the 2-halo and 1-halo contributions, which may be the most difficult regime to describe.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We investigate how unified models should be built to be able to predict the matter-density bispectrum (and power spectrum) from very large to small scales and that are at the same time consistent with perturbation theory at low k and with halo models at high k.  Methods: We use a Lagrangian framework to decompose the bispectrum into "3-halo", "2-halo", and "1-halo" contributions, related to "perturbative" and "non-perturbative" terms. We describe a simple implementation of this approach and present a detailed comparison with numerical simulations.  Results: We show that the 1-halo and 2-halo contributions contain counterterms that ensure their decay at low k, as required by physical constraints, and allow a better match to simulations. Contrary to the power spectrum, the standard 1-loop perturbation theory can be used for the perturbative 3-halo contribution because it does not grow too fast at high k. Moreover, it is much simpler and more accurate than two resummation schemes investigated in this paper. We obtain a good agreement with numerical simulations on both large and small scales, but the transition scales are poorly described by the simplest implementation. This cannot be amended by simple modifications to the halo parameters, but we show how it can be corrected for the power spectrum and the bispectrum through a simple interpolation scheme that is restricted to this intermediate regime. Then, we reach an accuracy on the order of 10% on mildly and highly nonlinear scales, while an accuracy on the order of 1% is obtained on larger weakly nonlinear scales. This also holds for the real-space two-point correlation function.},

	Abstract = {We perform high-resolution ray-tracing simulations to investigate probability distribution functions (PDFs) of lensing convergence, shear, and magnification on distant sources up to the redshift of zs = 20. We pay particular attention to the shot noise effect in N-body simulations by explicitly showing how it affects the variance of the convergence. We show that the convergence and magnification PDFs are closely related to each other via the approximate relation mu = (1 - kappa)-2, which can reproduce the behavior of PDFs surprisingly well up to the high magnification tail. The mean convergence measured in the source plane is found to be systematically negative, rather than zero as often assumed, and is correlated with the convergence variance. We provide simple analytical formulae for the PDFs, which reproduce simulated PDFs reasonably well for a wide range of redshifts and smoothing sizes. As explicit applications of our ray-tracing simulations, we examine the strong-lensing probability and the magnification effects on the luminosity functions of distant galaxies and quasars.},

	Abstract = {We study the sample variance of the matter power spectrum for the standard Lambda cold dark matter universe. We use a total of 5000 cosmological N-body simulations to study in detail the distribution of best-fit cosmological parameters and the baryon acoustic peak positions. The obtained distribution is compared with the results from the Fisher matrix analysis with and without including non-Gaussian errors. For the Fisher matrix analysis, we compute the derivatives of the matter power spectrum with respect to cosmological parameters using directly full nonlinear simulations. We show that the non-Gaussian errors increase the unmarginalized errors by up to a factor of five for k max = 0.4 h Mpc-1 if there is only one free parameter, provided other parameters are well determined by external information. On the other hand, for multi-parameter fitting, the impact of the non-Gaussian errors is significantly mitigated due to severe parameter degeneracies in the power spectrum. The distribution of the acoustic peak positions is well described by a Gaussian distribution, with its width being consistent with the statistical interval predicted from the Fisher matrix. We also examine systematic bias in the best-fit parameter due to the non-Gaussian errors. The bias is found to be smaller than the 1sigma statistical error for both the cosmological parameters and the acoustic scale positions.},

	Abstract = {We present the Millennium-II Simulation (MS-II), a very large N-body simulation of dark matter evolution in the concordance Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) cosmology. The MS-II assumes the same cosmological parameters and uses the same particle number and output data structure as the original Millennium Simulation (MS), but was carried out in a periodic cube one-fifth the size (100h-1Mpc) with five times better spatial resolution (a Plummer equivalent softening of 1.0h-1kpc) and with 125 times better mass resolution (a particle mass of 6.9 × 106h-1Msolar). By comparing results at MS and MS-II resolution, we demonstrate excellent convergence in dark matter statistics such as the halo mass function, the subhalo abundance distribution, the mass dependence of halo formation times, the linear and non-linear autocorrelations and power spectra, and halo assembly bias. Together, the two simulations provide precise results for such statistics over an unprecedented range of scales, from haloes similar to those hosting Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies to haloes corresponding to the richest galaxy clusters. The `Milky Way' haloes of the Aquarius Project were selected from a lower resolution version of the MS-II and were then resimulated at much higher resolution. As a result, they are present in the MS-II along with thousands of other similar mass haloes. A comparison of their assembly histories in the MS-II and in resimulations of 1000 times better resolution shows detailed agreement over a factor of 100 in mass growth. We publicly release halo catalogues and assembly trees for the MS-II in the same format within the same archive as those already released for the MS.},

	Abstract = {We study the lensing convergence power spectrum and its covariance for a standard LambdaCDM cosmology. We run 400 cosmological N-body simulations and use the outputs to perform a total of 1000 independent ray-tracing simulations. We compare the simulation results with analytic model predictions. The semianalytic model based on Smith et al. fitting formula underestimates the convergence power by ~ 30% at arcmin angular scales. For the convergence power spectrum covariance, the halo model reproduces the simulation results remarkably well over a wide range of angular scales and source redshifts. The dominant contribution at small angular scales comes from the sample variance due to the number fluctuations of halos in a finite survey volume. The signal-to-noise ratio for the convergence power spectrum is degraded by the non-Gaussian covariances by up to a factor of 5 for a weak lensing survey to zs ~ 1. The probability distribution of the convergence power spectrum estimators, among the realizations, is well approximated by a chi2 distribution with broadened variance given by the non-Gaussian covariance, but has a larger positive tail. The skewness and kurtosis have non-negligible values especially for a shallow survey. We argue that a prior knowledge on the full distribution may be needed to obtain an unbiased estimate on the ensemble-averaged band power at each angular scale from a finite volume survey.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree' method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 105 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

	Abstract = {Context: Weak-lensing surveys need accurate theoretical predictions for interpretation of their results and cosmological-parameter estimation. Aims: We study the accuracy of various approximations to cosmic shear and weak galaxy-galaxy lensing and investigate effects of Born corrections and lens-lens coupling.  Methods: We use ray-tracing through the Millennium Simulation, a large N-body simulation of cosmic structure formation, to calculate various cosmic-shear and galaxy-galaxy-lensing statistics. We compare the results from ray-tracing to semi-analytic predictions.  Results: (i) We confirm that the first-order approximation (i.e. neglecting lensing effects beyond first order in density fluctuations) provides an excellent fit to cosmic-shear power spectra as long as the actual matter power spectrum is used as input. Common fitting formulae, however, strongly underestimate the cosmic-shear power spectra (by >30% on scales ell>10 000). Halo models provide a better fit to cosmic shear-power spectra, but there are still noticeable deviations (˜10%). (ii) Cosmic-shear B-modes, which are induced by Born corrections and lens-lens coupling, are at least three orders of magnitude smaller than cosmic-shear E-modes. Semi-analytic extensions to the first-order approximation predict the right order of magnitude for the B-mode. Compared to the ray-tracing results, however, the semi-analytic predictions may differ by a factor two on small scales and also show a different scale dependence. (iii) The first-order approximation may under- or overestimate the galaxy-galaxy-lensing shear signal by several percent due to the neglect of magnification bias, which may lead to a correlation between the shear and the observed number density of lenses. Conclusions: (i) Current semi-analytic models need to be improved in order to match the degree of statistical accuracy expected for future weak-lensing surveys. (ii) Shear B-modes induced by corrections to the first-order approximation are not important for future cosmic-shear surveys. (iii) Magnification bias can be important for galaxy-galaxy-lensing surveys.},

	Abstract = {We present a modification of the standard halo model with the goal of providing an improved description of galaxy clustering. Recent surveys, like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Anglo-Australian two-degree survey (2dF), have shown that there seems to be a correlation between the clustering of galaxies and their properties such as metallicity and star formation rate, which are believed to be environment-dependent. This environmental dependence is not included in the standard halo model where the host halo mass is the only variable specifying galaxy properties. In our approach, the halo properties, i.e. the concentration, and the halo occupation distribution (HOD) prescription, will not only depend on the halo mass (like in the standard halo model) but also on the halo environment. We examine how different environmental dependence of halo concentration and HOD prescription affects the correlation function. We see that at the level of dark matter, the concentration of haloes moderately affects the dark matter correlation function only at small scales. However, the galaxy correlation function is extremely sensitive to the HOD details, even when only the HOD of a small fraction of haloes is modified.},

@article{Mohammed14,
	Abstract = {We develop a model for the matter power spectrum as the sum of Zeldovich approximation and even powers of k, i.e. A0 - A2k2 + A4k4 - ..., compensated at low k. With terms up to k4, the model can predict the true power spectrum to a few per cent accuracy up to k ˜ 0.7 h Mpc-1, over a wide range of redshifts and models. The An coefficients contain information about cosmology, in particular amplitude of fluctuations. We write a simple form of the covariance matrix as a sum of Gaussian part and A0 variance, which reproduces the simulations remarkably well. In contrast, we show that one needs an N-body simulation volume of more than 1000 (Gpc h-1)3 to converge to 1 per cent accuracy on covariance matrix. We investigate the supersample variance effect and show it can be modelled as an additional parameter that can be determined from the data. This allows a determination of sigma8 amplitude to about 0.2 per cent for a survey volume of 1(Gpc h-1)3, compared to 0.4 per cent otherwise. We explore the sensitivity of these coefficients to baryonic effects using hydrodynamic simulations of van Daalen et al. We find that because of baryons redistributing matter inside haloes all the coefficients A2n for n > 0 are strongly affected by baryonic effects, while A0 remains almost unchanged, a consequence of halo mass conservation. Our results suggest that observations such as weak lensing power spectrum can be effectively marginalized over the baryonic effects, while still preserving the bulk of the cosmological information contained in A0 and Zeldovich terms.},

@article{Smith03,
	Abstract = {We present the results of a large library of cosmological N-body simulations, using power-law initial spectra. The non-linear evolution of the matter power spectra is compared with the predictions of existing analytic scaling formulae based on the work of Hamilton et al. The scaling approach has assumed that highly non-linear structures obey `stable clustering' and are frozen in proper coordinates. Our results show that, when transformed under the self-similarity scaling, the scale-free spectra define a non-linear locus that is clearly shallower than would be required under stable clustering. Furthermore, the small-scale non-linear power increases as both the power spectrum index n and the density parameter Omega decrease, and this evolution is not well accounted for by the previous scaling formulae. This breakdown of stable clustering can be understood as resulting from the modification of dark matter haloes by continuing mergers. These effects are naturally included in the analytic `halo model' for non-linear structure; we use this approach to fit both our scale-free results and also our previous cold dark matter data. This method is more accurate than the commonly used Peacock-Dodds formula and should be applicable to more general power spectra. Code to evaluate non-linear power spectra using this method is available from <externallink type="url">http://as1.chem.nottingham.ac.uk/~res/software.html</A>. Following publication, we will make the power-law simulation data publically available through the Virgo website <externallink type="url">http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/Virgo/</A>.},

	Abstract = {Based on a suite of state-of-the-art high-resolution N-body simulations, we revisit the so-called halofit model as an accurate fitting formula for the nonlinear matter power spectrum. While the halofit model has frequently been used as a standard cosmological tool to predict the nonlinear matter power spectrum in a universe dominated by cold dark matter, its precision has been limited by the low resolution of N-body simulations used to determine the fitting parameters, suggesting the necessity of an improved fitting formula at small scales for future cosmological studies. We run high-resolution N-body simulations for 16 cosmological models around the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe best-fit cosmological parameters (one-, three-, five-, and seven-year results), including dark energy models with a constant equation of state. The simulation results are used to re-calibrate the fitting parameters of the halofit model so as to reproduce small-scale power spectra of the N-body simulations, while keeping the precision at large scales. The revised fitting formula provides an accurate prediction of the nonlinear matter power spectrum in a wide range of wavenumbers (k <= 30 h Mpc-1) at redshifts 0 <= z <= 10, with 5% precision for k <= 1 h Mpc-1 at 0 <= z <= 10 and 10% for 1 <= k <= 10 h Mpc-1 at 0 <= z <= 3. We discuss the impact of the improved halofit model on weak-lensing power spectra and correlation functions, and show that the improved model better reproduces ray-tracing simulation results.},

	Abstract = {The galaxy power spectrum is now a well-known tool of precision cosmology. In addition to the overall shape, baryon oscillations and the small-scale suppression of power by massive neutrinos capture complementary information on cosmological parameters when compared with the angular power spectrum of cosmic microwave background anisotropies. We study both the real-space and redshift-space galaxy power spectra in the context of non-linear effects, and model them based on the halo approach to large-scale structure clustering. We consider potential systematics in the cosmological parameter determination when non-linear effects are ignored and the galaxy power spectrum is described with the linear power spectrum scaled by a constant bias factor. We suggest that significant improvements can be made when non-linear effects are taken into account as a power-law contribution with two additional parameters to be determined from the data. In addition to cosmological parameters through galaxy clustering, such an approach allows a determination of useful information related to astrophysics on how galaxies occupy dark matter haloes.},

	Abstract = {We present a global measurement of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect obtained by cross correlating all relevant large-scale galaxy data sets with the cosmic microwave background radiation map provided by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. With these measurements, the overall ISW signal is detected at the ˜4.5sigma level. We also examine the cosmological implications of these measurements, particularly the dark energy equation of state w, its sound speed cs, and the overall curvature of the Universe. The flat LambdaCDM model is a good fit to the data and, assuming this model, we find that the ISW data constrain Omegam=0.20-0.11+0.19 at the 95% confidence level. When we combine our ISW results with the latest baryon oscillation and supernovae measurements, we find that the result is still consistent with a flat LambdaCDM model with w=-1 out to redshifts z>1.},

	Abstract = {We revisit the state of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect measurements in light of newly available data and address criticisms about the measurements which have recently been raised. We update the data set previously assembled by Giannantonio et al. to include new data releases for both the cosmic microwave background and the large-scale structure of the Universe. We find that our updated results are consistent with previous measurements. By fitting a single template amplitude, we now obtain a combined significance of the ISW detection at the 4.4sigma level, which fluctuates by ˜0.4sigma when alternative data cuts and analysis assumptions are considered. We also make new tests for systematic contaminations of the data, focusing in particular on the issues raised by Sawangwit et al. Amongst them, we address the rotation test, which aims at checking for possible systematics by correlating pairs of randomly rotated maps. We find results consistent with the expected data covariance, no evidence for enhanced correlation on any preferred axis of rotation, and therefore no indication of any additional systematic contamination. We publicly release the results, the covariance matrix and the sky maps used to obtain them.},

The observed cross correlation is 0.30$\pm$0.14muK at zero lag, with a shape consistent with that expected for correlations arising from the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. The photometric redshifts of the quasars are centered at z˜1.5, making this the deepest survey in which such a correlation has been observed.

	Abstract = {I discuss the correlation between the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies and the large scale structure of the local universe. This correlation has been proposed and studied in the literature as a probe of the dark energy and its physical properties. I consider a variety of large scale structure tracers suitable for a detection of the ISW effect via a cross correlation. In addition to luminous sources, I suggest the use of tracers such as dark matter halos or galaxy clusters. A suitable catalogue of mass selected halos for this purpose can be constructed with upcoming wide-field lensing and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect surveys. With multifrequency data, the presence of the ISW-large scale structure correlation can also be investigated through a cross-correlation of the frequency cleaned SZ and CMB maps. While convergence maps constructed from lensing surveys of the large scale structure via galaxy ellipticities are less correlated with the ISW effect, lensing potentials that deflect CMB photons are strongly correlated and allow, probably, the best mechanism to study the ISW-large scale structure correlation with CMB data alone.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the nonlinear extension to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW) resulting from the divergence of the large scale structure momentum density field. The nonlinear ISW effect leads to an increase in the total ISW contribution by roughly two orders of magnitude at l~1000. This increase, however, is still below the cosmic variance limit of the primary anisotropies; at further small angular scales, secondary effects such as gravitational lensing and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect dominate the nonlinear ISW power spectrum. We show that this second-order nonlinear ISW contribution is effectively the same as the contribution previously described as a lensing effect due to the transverse motion of gravitational lenses and well known as the Kaiser-Stebbins effect in the context of cosmic strings. Because of geometrical considerations, there is no significant three-point correlation function, or bispectrum, between the linear ISW effect and its nonlinear extension. The nonlinear ISW contribution can potentially be used as a probe of the transverse velocity of dark matter halos such as galaxy clusters. Because of the small contribution to temperature fluctuations, of the order of a few tenths of microkelvins, however, extracting useful measurements on velocities will be challenging.},

@article{Komatsu02,
	Abstract = {The angular power spectrum of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect is a powerful probe of cosmology. It is easier to detect than individual clusters in the field, is insensitive to observational selection effects and does not require a calibration between cluster mass and flux, reducing the systematic errors that dominate the cluster-counting constraints. It receives a dominant contribution from virialized cluster region between 20 and 40 per cent of the virial radius and is thus relatively insensitive to the poorly known gas physics in the cluster centre, such as cooling or (pre)heating. In this paper we derive a refined analytic prediction for the SZ angular power spectrum using the universal gas density and temperature profile and the dark matter halo mass function. The predicted power spectrum has no free parameters and fits all of the published hydrodynamic simulation results to better than a factor of 2 for 2000 < l < 10 000. We find that the angular power spectrum Cl scales as Cl~sigma78(Omegabh) 2 and is almost independent of all of the other cosmological parameters. This differs from the local cluster abundance studies, which give a relation between sigma8 and Omegam. We also compute the covariance matrix of Cl using the halo model and find a good agreement relative to the simulations. We argue that the best constraint from the SZ power spectrum comes from l~ 3000, where the sampling variance is sufficiently small and the spectrum is dominated by massive clusters above 1014h-1 Msolar for which cooling, heating and details of star formation are not very important. We estimate how well we can determine sigma8(Omegabh)2/7 with sampling-variance-limited observations and find that for a several-square-degree survey with arcmin resolution one should be able to determine sigma8 to within a few per cent, with the remaining uncertainty dominated by theoretical modelling. If the recent excess of the cosmic microwave background power on small scales reported by Cosmic Background Imager (CBI) and Berkeley Illinois Maryland Association (BIMA) experiments is due to the SZ effect, then we find sigma8(Omegabh/0.035)0.29= 1.04 +/- 0.12 at 95 per cent confidence level (statistical) and with a residual 10 per cent systematic (theoretical) uncertainty.},

@article{Takada03b,
	Abstract = {The lensing magnification effect due to large-scale structure is statistically measurable by the correlation of size fluctuations in distant galaxy images as well as by cross-correlation between foreground galaxies and background sources such as the QSO-galaxy cross-correlation. We use the halo model formulation of Takada & Jain to compute these magnification-induced correlations without employing the weak lensing approximation, mu~ 1 + 2kappa. Our predictions thus include the full contribution from non-linear magnification, deltamu>~ 1, that is due to lensing haloes. We compare the model prediction with ray-tracing simulations and find excellent agreement over the range of angular scales we consider (0.5 <~theta<~ 30 arcmin). In addition, we derive the dependence of the correlation amplitude on the maximum magnification cut-off mumax, which it is necessary to introduce in order to avoid the contributions from strong lensing events. For a general correlation function parametrized as <mupf> (f is any cosmic field correlated with the magnification field), the amplitude remains finite for p < 1 and diverges for p>= 1 as mumax->∞, independent of the details of the lensing mass distribution and of the separation angle. This consequence is verified by the halo model as well as by the simulations. Thus, the magnification correlation with p<= 1 has a practical advantage in that it is insensitive to a selection effect of how strong lensing events with mu>> 1 are observationally excluded from the sample.  The non-linear magnification contribution enhances the amplitude of the magnification correlation relative to the weak lensing approximation, and the non-linear correction is more significant on smaller angular scales and for sources at higher redshifts. The enhancement amounts to 10-25 per cent on arcmin scales for the QSO-galaxy cross-correlation, even after the inclusion of a realistic model of galaxy clustering within the host halo. Therefore, it is necessary to account for the non-linear contribution in theoretical models in order to make an unbiased, cosmological interpretation of the precise measurements expected from forthcoming massive surveys.},

The observational results are well reproduced in a Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) model based on the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 3-yr data, but a LambdaCDM model with higher sigma8, such as the one based on the WMAP 1-yr data, significantly overpredicts the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal. We model, separately, the contributions to the galaxy-galaxy lensing signals from different galaxies: central versus satellite, early type versus late type and galaxies in haloes of different masses. We also examine how the predicted galaxy-galaxy lensing signal depends on the shape, density profile and the location of the central galaxy with respect to its host halo.},

@article{Mandelbaum08,
	Abstract = {We perform a statistical weak lensing analysis of dark matter profiles around tracers of halo mass from galaxy-size to cluster-size halos. In this analysis we use 170 640 isolated ~L* galaxies split into ellipticals and spirals, 38 236 groups traced via isolated spectroscopic luminous red galaxies and 13 823 maxBCG clusters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey covering a wide range of richness. Together these three samples allow a determination of the density profiles of dark matter halos over three orders of magnitude in mass, from 10^{12}M_{\odot }  to 10^{15}M_{\odot } . The resulting lensing signal is consistent with a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) or Einasto profile on scales outside the central region. In the inner regions, uncertainty in modeling of the proper identification of the halo center and inclusion of baryonic effects from the central galaxy make the comparison less reliable. We find that the NFW concentration parameter c200b decreases with halo mass, from around 10 for galactic halos to 4 for cluster halos. Assuming its dependence on halo mass in the form of c_{200b}=c_0 (M/10^{14}{h}^{-1}~M_{\odot  })^{-\beta }  we find c0 = 4.6 $\pm$ 0.7 (at z = 0.22) and beta = 0.13 $\pm$ 0.07, with very similar results for the Einasto profile. The slope (beta) is in agreement with theoretical predictions, while the amplitude is about two standard deviations below the predictions for this mass and redshift, but we note that the published values in the literature differ at a level of 10-20% and that for a proper comparison our analysis should be repeated in simulations. We compare our results to other recent determinations, some of which find significantly higher concentrations. We discuss the implications of our results for the baryonic effects on the shear power spectrum: since these are expected to increase the halo concentration, the fact that we see no evidence of high concentrations on scales above 20% of the virial radius suggests that baryonic effects are limited to small scales, and are not a significant source of uncertainty for the current weak lensing measurements of the dark matter power spectrum.},

	Abstract = {We present a new measurement of the mass-concentration relation and the stellar-to-halo mass ratio over a 5*10^(12) solar mass to 2*10^(14) solar mass range. To achieve this, we use the CFHT Stripe 82 Survey (CS82) weak lensing data combined with a well defined catalog of clusters (the redMaPPer catalogue) and the LOWZ/CMASS galaxies of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Tenth Data Release (SDSS-III BOSS DR10). The stacked lensing signals around these samples are modeled as a sum of contributions from the central galaxy, the dark matter halo, and the neighboring halos. We measure the mass-concentration relation: c200(M)=A(M200/M0)^(B) with A=5.25+/-1.67, B=-0.13+/-0.12 for 0.2<z<0.4 and A=6.77+/-1.13, B=-0.15+/-0.06 for 0.4<z<0.6. We conclude that the amplitude A and slope B are both consistent with the simulation predictions by Klypin et al. (2014) within the errors. We also measure the stellar-to-halo mass ratio and find it to be flatter than previous measurement for high stellar masses because of the complex structures and merger history in massive dark matter halos.},

	Abstract = {We examine the age dependence of dark matter halo clustering at an unprecedented accuracy using a set of seven high-resolution cosmological simulations, each with N=10243 particles. We measure the bias parameters for halos over a large mass range using the cross-power-spectrum method that can effectively suppress the random noise, even in the sparse sampling of the most massive halos. This enables us to find, for the first time, that younger halos are more strongly clustered than older ones for halo masses M>10M*, where M* is the characteristic nonlinear mass scale. For M<M*, our results confirm the previous finding of Gao et al. that older halos are clustered more strongly than the younger ones. We also study the halo bias as a function of halo concentration, and find that the concentration dependence is weaker than the age dependence for M<M*, but stronger for M>~50M*. The accurate and robust measurement of the age dependences of halo bias points to a limitation of the simple excursion-set theory, which predicts that the formation and structure of a halo of given mass is independent of its environment.},

@article{Hagan05,
	Abstract = {We explore the effect of substructure in dark matter halos on the power spectrum and bispectrum of matter fluctuations and weak-lensing shear. By experimenting with substructure in a cosmological N=5123 simulation, we find that when a larger fraction of the host halo mass is in subhalos, the resulting power spectrum has less power at 1<~k<~100 h Mpc-1 and more power at k>~100 h Mpc-1. We explain this effect using an analytic halo model including subhalos, which shows that the 1<~k<~100 h Mpc-1 regime depends sensitively on the radial distribution of subhalo centers, while the interior structure of subhalos is important at k>~100 h Mpc-1. The corresponding effect on the weak-lensing power spectrum due to substructures is up to ~11% at angular scale l<~104. Predicting the nonlinear power spectrum to a few percent accuracy for future surveys would therefore require large cosmological simulations that also have exquisite numerical resolution to model accurately the survivals of dark matter subhalos in the tidal fields of their hosts.},

@article{Fosalba05,
	Abstract = {We perform detailed comparison of the semianalytic halo model predictions with measurements in numerical simulations of the two- and three-point correlation functions, as well as power spectrum and bispectrum. We discuss the accuracy and self-consistency of the halo model description of gravitational clustering in the nonlinear regime and constrain halo model parameters. We exploit the recently proposed multipole expansion of three-point statistics that expresses rotation invariance in the most natural way. This not only offers technical advantages by reducing the integrals required for the halo model predictions, but also amounts to a convenient way of compressing the information contained in the three-point correlation functions (3PCFs). We find that, with an appropriate choice of the halo boundary and mass function cutoff, halo model predictions are in good agreement with the bispectrum measured in numerical simulations. However, the halo model predicts less than the observed configuration dependence of the 3PCF on ~megaparsec scales. This effect is mainly due to quadrupole moment deficit, possibly related to the assumption of spherical halo geometry. Our analysis shows that using its harmonic decomposition, the full configuration dependence of the 3PCF in the nonlinear regime can be compressed into just a few numbers, the lowest multipoles. Moreover, these multipoles are closely related to the highest signal-to-noise eigenmodes of the 3PCF. Therefore this estimator may simplify future analyses aimed at constraining cosmological and halo model parameters from observational data.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed nonspherical modeling of dark matter halos on the basis of a combined analysis of high-resolution halo simulations (12 halos with N~106 particles within their virial radius) and large cosmological simulations (five realizations with N=5123 particles in a 100h-1 Mpc box size). The density profiles of those simulated halos are well approximated by a sequence of the concentric triaxial distribution with their axis directions being fairly aligned. We characterize the triaxial model quantitatively by generalizing the universal density profile, that has previously been discussed only in the framework of the spherical model. We obtain a series of practically useful fitting formulae in applying the triaxial model: the mass and redshift dependence of the axis ratio, the mean of the concentration parameter, and the probability distribution functions of the axis ratio and the concentration parameter. These accurate fitting formulae form a complete description of the triaxial density profiles of halos in cold dark matter models. Our current description of the dark halos will be particularly useful in predicting a variety of nonsphericity effects, to a reasonably reliable degree, including the weak and strong lens statistics, the orbital evolution of galactic satellites and triaxiality of galactic halos, and the nonlinear clustering of dark matter. In addition, this provides a useful framework for the nonspherical modeling of the intracluster gas, which is crucial in discussing the gas and temperature profiles of X-ray clusters and the Hubble constant estimated via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect.},

	Abstract = {We present an analytic model for the fully nonlinear two- and three-point correlation functions of the cosmological mass density field, and their Fourier transforms, the mass power spectrum and bispectrum. The model is based on physical properties of dark matter halos, with the three main model inputs being analytic halo density profiles, halo mass functions, and halo-halo spatial correlations, each of which has been well studied in the literature. We demonstrate that this new model can reproduce the power spectrum and bispectrum computed from cosmological simulations of both an n=-2 scale-free model and a low-density cold dark matter model. To enhance the dynamic range of these large simulations, we use the synthetic-halo replacement technique of Ma & Fry, in which the original halos with numerically softened cores are replaced by synthetic halos of realistic density profiles. At high wavenumbers, our model predicts a slope for the nonlinear power spectrum different from the often-used fitting formulas in the literature based on the stable-clustering assumption. Our model also predicts a three-point amplitude, Q, that is scale dependent, in contrast to the popular hierarchical clustering assumption. This model provides a rapid way to compute the mass power spectrum and bispectrum over all length scales where the input halo properties are valid. It also provides a physical interpretation of the clustering properties of matter in the universe.},

@article{jingyp00,
	Abstract = {We study the diversity of the density profiles of dark matter halos based on a large set of high-resolution cosmological simulations of 2563 particles. The cosmological models include four scale-free models and three representative cold dark matter models. The simulations have good force resolution. In each cosmological model, there are about 400 massive halos that have more than 104 particles within the virial radius. Our unbiased selection of all massive halos enables us to quantify how well the bulk of dark matter halos can be described by the Navarro, Frenk, & White (NFW) profile, which was established for equilibrium halos. We find that about 70% of the halos can be fitted by the NFW profile with a fitting residual dvimax<0.3 in Omega0=1 universes. This percentage is higher in the low-density cosmological models of Omega0=0.3. The rest of the halos exhibit larger deviations from the NFW profile for more significant internal substructures. There is a considerable amount of variation in the density profile even among the halos that can be fitted by the NFW profile (i.e., dvimax<0.30). The distribution of the profile parameter, the concentration c, can be described well by a lognormal function with the mean value c slightly smaller (15%) than the NFW result and the dispersion, sigmac, in lnc, of about 0.25. More virialized halos with dvimax<0.15 have a mean value c in better agreement with the NFW result, and their dispersion, sigmac, is also slightly smaller (about 0.2). Our results can alleviate some of the conflicts found recently between the theoretical NFW profile and observational results. Implications for theoretical and observational studies of galaxy formation are discussed.},

@article{Schneider12,
	Abstract = {We present measurements of the triaxial dark matter halo shapes and alignment correlation functions in the Millennium and Millennium-2 dark matter N-body simulations. These two simulations allow us to measure the distributions of halo shapes down to 10% of the virial radius over a halo mass range of 6 × 109-2 × 1014 h-1Modot. We largely confirm previous results on the distributions of halo axis ratios as a function of halo mass, but we find that the median angle between halo major axes at different halo radii can vary by a factor of 2 between the Millennium-1 and 2 simulations because of the different mass resolution. Thus, error in the shape determinations from limited resolution is potentially degenerate with the misalignment of halo inner and outer shapes used to constrain Brightest Cluster Galaxy alignments in previous works. We also present simplifying parameterizations for the 3-D halo-mass alignment correlation functions that are necessary ingredients for triaxial halo models of large-scale structure and models of galaxy intrinsic alignments as contaminants for cosmic shear surveys. We measure strong alignments between halos of all masses and the surrounding dark matter overdensities out to several tens of h-1 Mpc, in agreement with observed shear-galaxy and cluster shape correlations. We use these measurements to forecast the contribution to the weak lensing signal around galaxy clusters from correlated mass along the line-of-sight. For prolate clusters with major axes aligned with the line-of-sight the fraction of the weak lensing signal from mass external to the cluster can be twice that predicted if the excess halo alignment correlation is assumed to be zero.},

@article{caiyc10,
	Abstract = {We present a new method for constructing maps of the secondary temperature fluctuations imprinted on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation by photons propagating through the evolving cosmic gravitational potential. Large cosmological N-body simulations are used to calculate the complete non-linear evolution of the peculiar gravitational potential. Tracing light rays back through the past light cone of a chosen observer accurately captures the temperature perturbations generated by linear (the integrated Sachs-Wolfe or ISW effect) and non-linear (the Rees-Sciama or RS effect) evolution. These effects give rise to three kinds of non-linear features in the temperature maps. (i) In overdense regions, converging flows of matter induce cold spots of the order of 100 Mpc in extent which can dominate over the ISW effect at high redshift, and are surrounded by hot rings. (ii) In underdense regions, the RS effect enhances ISW cold spots which can be surrounded by weak hot rings. (iii) Transverse motions of large lumps of matter produce characteristic dipole features, consisting of adjacent hot and cold spots separated by a few tens of megaparsecs. These non-linear features are not easily detectable; they modulate the ISW sky maps at about the 10 per cent level. The RS effect causes the angular power spectrum to deviate from linear theory at l ~ 50 and generates non-Gaussianity, skewing the one-point distribution function to negative values. Cold spots of similar angular size, but much smaller amplitude than the CMB cold spot reported by Cruz et al. are produced. Joint analysis of our maps and the corresponding galaxy distribution may enable techniques to be developed to detect these non-linear, non-Gaussian features. Our maps are available at http://astro.dur.ac.uk/~cai/ISW.},

@article{McDonald06,
	Abstract = {We present N-body simulation calculations of the dependence of the power spectrum of non-linear cosmological mass density fluctuations on the equation of state of the dark energy, w=p/rho. At fixed linear theory power, increasing w leads to an increase in non-linear power, with the effect increasing with k. By k= 10hMpc-1, a model with w=-0.75 has ~12 per cent more power than a standard cosmological constant model (w=-1), while a model with w=-0.5 has ~33 per cent extra power (at z= 0). The size of the effect increases with increasing dark energy fraction, and to a lesser extent increasing power spectrum normalization, but is insensitive to the power spectrum shape (the numbers above are for Omegam= 0.281 and sigma8= 0.897). A code quantifying the non-linear effect of varying w, as a function of k, z and other cosmological parameters, which should be accurate to a few per cent for k<~ 10hMpc-1 for models that fit the current observations, is available at http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~pmcdonal/code.html. This paper also serves as an example of a detailed exploration of the numerical convergence properties of ratios of power spectra for different models, which can be useful because some kinds of numerical error cancel in a ratio. When precision calculations based on numerical simulations are needed for many different models, efficiency may be gained by breaking the problem into a calculation of the absolute prediction at a central point, and calculations of the relative change in the prediction with model parameters.},

	Abstract = {We discuss in the framework of the excursion set formalism a recent discovery from N-body simulations that the clustering of haloes of given mass depends on their formation history. We review why the standard implementation of this formalism is unable to explain such dependencies, and we show that this can, in principle, be rectified by implementing in full an ellipsoidal collapse model where collapse depends not only on the overdensity but also on the shape of the initial density field. We also present an alternative remedy for this deficiency, namely the inclusion of collapse barriers for pancakes and filaments, together with the assumption that formation history depends on when these barriers are crossed. We implement both these extensions in a generalized excursion set method, and run large Monte Carlo realizations to quantify the effects. Our results suggest that effects as large as those found in simulations can only arise in the excursion set formalism if the formation history of a halo does indeed depend on the size of its progenitor filaments and pancakes. We also present conditional distributions of progenitor pancakes and filaments for low-mass haloes identified at present epoch, and discuss a recent claim by Mo et al. that most low-mass haloes were embedded in massive pancakes at z ~ 2.},

	Abstract = {Peculiar velocity surveys, which measure galaxy velocities directly from standard candles in addition to redshifts, can provide strong constraints on the growth rate of structure at low redshift. The improvement originates from the physical relationship between galaxy density and peculiar velocity, which substantially reduces cosmic variance. We use Fisher matrix forecasts to show that peculiar velocity data can improve the growth rate constraints by about a factor of 2 compared to density alone for surveys with galaxy number density of 10-2 (h-1 Mpc)-3, if we can use all the information for wavenumber k <= 0.2 h Mpc-1. In the absence of accurate theoretical models at k = 0.2 h Mpc- 1, the improvement over redshift-only surveys is even larger - around a factor of 5 for k <= 0.1 h Mpc-1. Future peculiar velocity surveys, Transforming Astronomical Imaging surveys through Polychromatic Analysis of Nebulae (TAIPAN), and the all-sky H I surveys, Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind Survey (WALLABY) and Westerbork Northern Sky H I Survey (WNSHS), can measure the growth rate to 3 per cent at z ˜ 0.025. Although the velocity subsample is about an order of magnitude smaller than the redshift sample from the same survey, it improves the constraint by 40 per cent compared to the same survey without velocity measurements. Peculiar velocity surveys can also measure the growth rate as a function of wavenumber with 15-30 per cent uncertainties in bins with widths Deltak = 0.01 h Mpc-1 in the range k <= 0.1 h Mpc-1, which is a large improvement over galaxy density only. Such measurements on very large scales can detect signatures of modified gravity or non-Gaussianity through scale-dependent growth rate or galaxy bias. We test our modelling in detail using N-body simulations.},

@article{Berge12,
	Abstract = {Point spread function (PSF) modelling is a central part of any astronomy data analysis relying on measuring the shapes of objects. It is especially crucial for weak gravitational lensing, in order to beat down systematics and allow one to reach the full potential of weak lensing in measuring dark energy. A PSF modelling pipeline is made of two main steps: the first one is to assess its shape on stars, and the second is to interpolate it at any desired position (usually galaxies). We focus on the second part, and compare different interpolation schemes, including polynomial interpolation, radial basis functions, Delaunay triangulation and Kriging. For that purpose, we develop simulations of PSF fields, in which stars are built from a set of basis functions defined from a principal components analysis of a real ground-based image. We find that Kriging gives the most reliable interpolation, significantly better than the traditionally used polynomial interpolation. We also note that although a Kriging interpolation on individual images is enough to control systematics at the level necessary for current weak lensing surveys, more elaborate techniques will have to be developed to reach future ambitious surveys' requirements.},

@article{Navarro96,
	Abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard cold dark matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fitted over two decades in radius by scaling a simple "universal" profile. The characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii but are significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r-2 near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process, and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.},

We first describe the model, and demonstrate its accuracy by comparing its predictions with exact results from numerical simulations of non-linear gravitational clustering. We then present several astrophysical applications of the halo model: these include models of the spatial distribution of galaxies, the non-linear velocity, momentum and pressure fields, descriptions of weak gravitational lensing, and estimates of secondary contributions to temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background.},

	Abstract = {We develop the formalism to include substructure in the halo model of clustering. Real haloes are not likely to be perfectly smooth, but have substructure which has, to date, been neglected in the halo model - our formalism allows one to estimate the effects of this substructure on measures of clustering. We derive expressions for the two-point correlation function, the power-spectrum, the cross-correlation between galaxies and mass, as well as higher order clustering measures. Simple forms of the formulae are obtained for the limit in which the size of the substructure and the mass fraction in it is small. Inclusion of substructure allows for a more accurate analysis of the statistical effects of gravitational lensing. It may also bring the halo model predictions into better agreement with the small-scale structure seen in recent high-resolution simulations of hierarchical clustering.},

	Abstract = {We analyse the properties of substructures within dark matter haloes (subhaloes) using a set of high-resolution numerical simulations of the formation of structure in a LambdaCDM universe. Our simulation set includes 11 high-resolution simulations of massive clusters as well as a region of mean density, allowing us to study the spatial and mass distribution of substructures down to a mass resolution limit of 109h-1 Msolar. We also investigate how the properties of substructures vary as a function of the mass of the `parent' halo in which they are located. We find that the substructure mass function depends at most weakly on the mass of the parent halo and is well described by a power law. The radial number density profiles of substructures are steeper in low mass haloes than in high-mass haloes. More massive substructures tend to avoid the centres of haloes and are preferentially located in the external regions of their parent haloes. We also study the mass accretion and merging histories of substructures, which we find to be largely independent of environment. We find that a significant fraction of the substructures residing in clusters at the present day were accreted at redshifts z < 1. This implies that a significant fraction of present-day `passive' cluster galaxies were still outside the cluster progenitor and were more active at z~ 1.},

We compare halo-model predictions with results based on N-body simulations, but also extend our predictions to 10-kpc scales which will be probed by future simulations. We find that weak-lensing surveys proposed for the coming decade can probe the power spectrum on small enough scales to detect substructure in massive haloes. We discuss the prospects of constraining the mass fraction in substructure in view of partial degeneracies with parameters such as the tilt and running of the primordial power spectrum.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the subhalo populations of dark matter haloes in the concordance Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) cosmology. We use a large cosmological simulation and a variety of high-resolution resimulations of individual cluster and galaxy haloes to study the systematics of subhalo populations over ranges of 1000 in halo mass and 1000 in the ratio of subhalo to parent halo mass. The subhalo populations of different haloes are not scaled copies of each other, but vary systematically with halo properties. On average, the amount of substructure increases with halo mass. At fixed mass, it decreases with halo concentration and with halo formation redshift. These trends are comparable in size to the scatter in subhalo abundance between similar haloes. Averaged over all haloes of given mass, the abundance of low-mass subhaloes per unit parent halo mass is independent of parent mass. It is very similar to the abundance per unit mass of low-mass haloes in the Universe as a whole, once differing boundary definitions for subhaloes and haloes are accounted for. The radial distribution of subhaloes within their parent haloes is substantially less centrally concentrated than that of the dark matter. It varies at most weakly with the mass (or concentration) of the parent halo and not at all with subhalo mass. It does depend on the criteria used to define the subhalo population considered. About 90 per cent of present-day subhaloes were accreted after z= 1 and about 70 per cent after z= 0.5. Only about 8 per cent of the total mass of all haloes accreted at z= 1 survives as bound subhaloes at z= 0. For haloes accreted at z= 2, the survival mass fraction is just 2 per cent. Subhaloes seen near the centre of their parent typically were accreted earlier and retain less of their original mass than those seen near the edge. These strong systematics mean that comparison with galaxies in real clusters is only possible if the formation of the luminous component is modelled appropriately.},

@article{Smith05,
	Abstract = {We develop the halo model of large-scale structure to include triaxial dark matter haloes and their intrinsic alignments. As a direct application we derive general expressions for the two-point correlation function and the power spectrum. We then focus on the power spectrum and numerically solve the general expressions for two different models of the triaxial profiles. The first is a toy model that allows us to isolate the dependence of clustering on halo shape alone and the second is the more realistic profile model of Jing & Suto. In both cases, we find that the effect of triaxiality is manifest as a suppression of power at the level of ~5 per cent on scales k~ 1-10hMpc-1, which in real space corresponds to the virial radii of clusters. When considered by mass, we find that for the first model the effects are again apparent as a suppression of power and that they are more significant for the high-mass haloes. For the Jing & Suto model, we find a suppression of power on large scales followed by a sharp amplification on small scales at the level of ~10-15 per cent. Interestingly, when averaged over the entire mass function this amplification effect is suppressed. We also find for the one-halo term on scales k < 10hMpc-1 that the power is dominated by ellipsoidal haloes with semi-minor to semi-major axis ratios a/c < 0.7.  One of the important features of our formalism is that it allows for the self-consistent inclusion of the intrinsic alignments of haloes. The alignments are specified through the correlation function of halo seeds. We develop a useful toy model for this and then make estimates of the alignment contribution to the power spectrum. Further, through consideration of the (artificial) case where all haloes are perfectly aligned, we calculate the maximum possible contribution to the clustering. We find the hard limit of <10 per cent. Subject to further scrutiny, the proposed toy model may serve as a means for linking the actual observed intrinsic alignments of galaxies to physical quantities of interest.},

@article{Hamilton06,
	Abstract = {We show how to estimate the covariance of the power spectrum of a statistically homogeneous and isotropic density field from a single periodic simulation, by applying a set of weightings to the density field, and by measuring the scatter in power spectra between different weightings. We recommend a specific set of 52 weightings containing only combinations of fundamental modes, constructed to yield a minimum variance estimate of the covariance of power. Numerical tests reveal that at non-linear scales the variance of power estimated by the weightings method substantially exceeds that estimated from a simple ensemble method. We argue that the discrepancy is caused by beat-coupling, in which products of closely spaced Fourier modes couple by non-linear gravitational growth to the beat mode between them. Beat-coupling appears whenever non-linear power is measured from Fourier modes with a finite spread of wavevector, and is therefore present in the weightings method but not in the ensemble method. Beat-coupling inevitably affects real galaxy surveys, whose Fourier modes have finite width. Surprisingly, the beat-coupling contribution dominates the covariance of power at non-linear scales, so that, counter-intuitively, it is expected that the covariance of non-linear power in galaxy surveys is dominated not by small-scale structure, but rather by beat-coupling to the largest scales of the survey.},

@article{Neto07,
	Abstract = {We use the Millennium Simulation (MS) to study the statistics of Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) halo concentrations at z = 0. Our results confirm that the average halo concentration declines monotonically with mass; the concentration-mass relation is well fitted by a power law over three decades in mass, up to the most massive objects that form in a LambdaCDM universe (~ 1015h-1Msolar). This is in clear disagreement with the predictions of the model proposed by Bullock et al. for these rare objects, and agrees better with the original predictions of Navarro, Frenk & White. The large volume surveyed, together with the unprecedented numerical resolution of the MS, allows us to estimate with confidence the distribution of concentrations and, consequently, the abundance of systems with unusual properties. About one in a hundred cluster haloes (M200 >~ 3 × 1014h-1Msolar) have concentrations exceeding c200 = 7.5, a result that may be useful in interpreting the likelihood of unusually strong massive gravitational lenses, such as Abell 1689, in the LambdaCDM cosmogony. A similar fraction of about 1 per cent of galaxy-sized haloes (M200 ~ 1012h-1Msolar) have c200 < 4.5 and this could be relevant to models that attempt to reconcile the LambdaCDM cosmology with rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies by appealing to haloes of unexpectedly low concentration. We find that halo concentrations are independent of spin once haloes manifestly out of equilibrium have been removed from the sample. Compared to their relaxed brethren, the concentrations of out-of-equilibrium haloes tend to be lower and have more scatter, while their spins tend to be higher. A number of previously noted trends within the halo population are induced primarily by these properties of unrelaxed systems. Finally, we compare the result of predicting halo concentrations using the mass assembly history of the main progenitor with predictions based on simple arguments regarding the assembly time of all progenitors. The latter are typically as good or better than the former, suggesting that halo concentration depends not only on the evolutionary path of a halo's main progenitor, but on how and when all of its constituents collapsed to form non-linear objects.},

	Abstract = {Accurate knowledge of the non-linear dark matter power spectrum is important for understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe, the statistics of dark matter haloes and their evolution, and cosmological gravitational lensing. We analytically model the dark matter power spectrum and its cross-power spectrum with dark matter haloes. Our model extends the halo model formalism, including realistic substructure population within individual dark matter haloes and the scatter of the concentration parameter at fixed halo mass. We consider three prescriptions for the mass-concentration relation and two for the substructure distribution in dark matter haloes. We show that this extension of the halo model mainly increases the predicted power on the small scales and is crucial for properly modelling the cosmological weak-lensing signal due to low-mass haloes. Our extended formalism shows how the halo model approach can be improved in accuracy as one increases the number of ingredients that are calibrated from N-body simulations.},

	Abstract = {We study the population statistics of the surviving subhaloes of LambdaCDM dark matter haloes using a set of very high resolution N-body simulations. These include both simulations of representative regions of the Universe and ultra-high resolution resimulations of individual dark matter haloes. We find that more massive haloes tend to have a larger mass fraction in subhaloes. For example, cluster size haloes typically have 7.5 per cent of the mass within R200 in substructures of fractional mass larger than 10-5, which is 25 per cent higher than galactic haloes. There is, however, a large variance in the subhalo mass fraction from halo to halo, whereas the subhalo abundance shows much higher regularity. For dark matter haloes of fixed mass, the subhalo abundance decreases by 30 per cent between redshift 2 and 0. The subhalo abundance function correlates with the host halo concentration parameter and formation redshift. However, the intrinsic scatter is not significantly reduced for narrow ranges of concentration parameter or formation redshift, showing that they are not the dominant parameters that determine the subhalo abundance in a halo.},

	Abstract = {We study the prospects for detecting the annihilation products of dark matter (DM) in the framework of the two highest-resolution numerical simulations currently available, i.e., Via Lactea II and Aquarius. We propose a strategy to determine the shape and size of the region around the Galactic center that maximizes the probability of observing a DM signal, and we show that, although the predicted flux can differ by a factor of 10 for a given DM candidate in the two simulation setups, the search strategy remains actually unchanged, since it relies on the angular profile of the annihilation flux, not on its normalization. We present mock gamma-ray maps that keep into account the diffuse emissions produced by unresolved halos in the Galaxy, and we show that, in an optimistic DM scenario, a few individual clumps can be resolved above the background with the Fermi-LAT. Finally, we calculate the energy-dependent boost factors for positrons and antiprotons and show that they are always of O(1), and, therefore, they cannot lead to the large enhancements of the antimatter fluxes required to explain the recent PAMELA, ATIC, Fermi, and HESS data. Still, we show that the annihilation of 100 GeV weakly interacting massive particles into charged lepton pairs may contribute significantly to the positron budget.},

	Abstract = {We combine the physics of the ellipsoidal collapse model with the excursion set theory to study the shapes of dark matter haloes. In particular, we develop an analytic approximation to the non-linear evolution that is more accurate than the Zeldovich approximation; we introduce a planar representation of halo axial ratios, which allows a concise and intuitive description of the dynamics of collapsing regions and allows one to relate the final shape of a halo to its initial shape; we provide simple physical explanations for some empirical fitting formulae obtained from numerical studies. Comparison with simulations is challenging, as there is no agreement about how to define a non-spherical gravitationally bound object. Nevertheless, we find that our model matches the conditional minor-to-intermediate axial ratio distribution rather well, although it disagrees with the numerical results in reproducing the minor-to-major axial ratio distribution. In particular, the mass dependence of the minor-to-major axis distribution appears to be the opposite to what is found in many previous numerical studies, where low-mass haloes are preferentially more spherical than high-mass haloes. In our model, the high-mass haloes are predicted to be more spherical, consistent with results based on a more recent and elaborate halo finding algorithm, and with observations of the mass dependence of the shapes of early-type galaxies. We suggest that some of the disagreement with some previous numerical studies may be alleviated if we consider only isolated haloes.},

	Abstract = {We study the amount and distribution of dark matter substructures within dark matter haloes, using a large set of high-resolution simulations ranging from group-size to cluster-size haloes, and carried out within a cosmological model consistent with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 7-year data. In particular, we study how the measured properties of subhaloes vary as a function of the parent halo mass, the physical properties of the parent halo and redshift. The fraction of halo mass in substructures increases with increasing mass: it is of the order of 5 per cent for haloes with M200˜ 1013  M&sun; and of the order of 10 per cent for the most massive haloes in our sample, with M200˜ 1015  M&sun;. There is, however, a very large halo-to-halo scatter that can be explained only in part by a range of halo physical properties, e.g. concentration. At a given halo mass, less concentrated haloes contain significantly larger fractions of mass in substructures because of the reduced strength of tidal disruption. Most of the substructure mass is located at the outskirts of the parent haloes, in relatively few massive subhaloes. This mass segregation appears to become stronger at increasing redshift, and should reflect into a more significant mass segregation of the galaxy population at different cosmic epochs. When haloes are accreted on to larger structures, their mass is significantly reduced by tidal stripping. Haloes that are more massive at the time of accretion (these should host more luminous galaxies) are brought closer to the centre on shorter time-scales by dynamical friction, and therefore suffer a more significant stripping. The halo merger rate depends strongly on the environment with substructure in more massive haloes suffering more important mergers than their counterparts residing in less massive systems. This should translate into a different morphological mix for haloes of different mass.},

	Abstract = {We address the amount of information in the non-Gaussian regime of weak lensing surveys by modelling all relevant covariances of the power spectra and bispectra, using 1000 ray-tracing simulation realizations for a Lambdacold dark matter (LambdaCDM) model and an analytical halo model. We develop a formalism to describe the covariance matrices of power spectra and bispectra of all triangle configurations. In addition to the known contributions which extend up to six-point correlation functions, we propose a new contribution `the halo sample variance (HSV)' arising from the coupling of the lensing Fourier modes with large-scale mass fluctuations on scales comparable with the survey region via halo bias theory. We show that the model predictions are in good agreement with the simulation once we take the HSV into account. The HSV gives a dominant contribution to the covariance matrices at multipoles l ≳ 103, which arises from massive haloes with a mass of ≳ 1014 M&sun; and at relatively low redshifts z ≲ 0.4. Since such haloes are easily identified from a multi-colour imaging survey, the effect can be estimated from the data. By adding the bispectrum to the power spectrum, the total information content or the cumulative signal-to-noise ratio up to a certain maximum multipole lmax of a few 103, (S/N)lmax, is improved by 20-50 per cent, which is equivalent to a factor of 1.4-2.3 larger survey area for the power spectrum measurement alone. However, it is still smaller than the case of a Gaussian field by a factor of 3 mostly due to the HSV. Thus bispectrum measurements are useful for cosmology, but using information from upcoming surveys requires that non-Gaussian covariances are carefully estimated.},

@article{Takada13,
	Abstract = {We provide a simple, unified approach to describing the impact of super-sample covariance, or beat coupling, on power spectrum estimation in a finite-volume survey. For a wide range of survey volumes, the sample variance that arises from modes that are larger than the survey dominates the covariance of power spectrum estimators for modes much smaller than the survey. The deeply nonlinear version of this effect is known as halo sample variance. We show that all variants are unified by the matter trispectrum of squeezed configurations and that such configurations obey a consistency relation which relates them to the response of the power spectrum to a change in the background density. Our method also applies to statistics that are based on radial projections of the density field such as weak lensing shear. While we use the halo model for an analytic description to expose the nature of the effect, the consistency description enables an accurate calibration of the full effect directly from simulations. It also suggests that super-sample covariance may be viewed as an additional interesting signal rather than excess noise.},

@article{liyin14,
	Abstract = {Using separate universe simulations, we accurately quantify super-sample covariance (SSC), the typically dominant sampling error for matter power spectrum estimators in a finite volume, which arises from the presence of super survey modes. By quantifying the power spectrum response to a background mode, this approach automatically captures the separate effects of beat coupling in the quasilinear regime, halo sample variance in the nonlinear regime and a new dilation effect which changes scales in the power spectrum coherently across the survey volume, including the baryon acoustic oscillation scale. It models these effects at typically the few percent level or better with a handful of small volume simulations for any survey geometry compared with directly using many thousands of survey volumes in a suite of large-volume simulations. The stochasticity of the response is sufficiently small that in the quasilinear regime, SSC can be alternately included by fitting the mean density in the volume with these fixed templates in parameter estimation. We also test the halo model prescription and find agreement typically at better than the 10% level for the response.},

@article{Johnson14,
	Abstract = {We present scale-dependent measurements of the normalized growth rate of structure fsigma8(k, z = 0) using only the peculiar motions of galaxies. We use data from the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey velocity sample together with a newly compiled sample of low-redshift (z < 0.07) Type Ia supernovae. We constrain the growth rate in a series of Deltak ˜ 0.03 h Mpc-1 bins to ˜35 per cent precision, including a measurement on scales >300 h-1 Mpc, which represents one of the largest scale growth rate measurement to date. We find no evidence for a scale-dependence in the growth rate, or any statistically significant variation from the growth rate as predicted by the Planck cosmology. Bringing all the scales together, we determine the normalized growth rate at z = 0 to ˜15 per cent in a manner independent of galaxy bias and in excellent agreement with the constraint from the measurements of redshift-space distortions from 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey. We pay particular attention to systematic errors. We point out that the intrinsic scatter present in Fundamental Plane and Tully-Fisher relations is only Gaussian in logarithmic distance units; wrongly assuming it is Gaussian in linear (velocity) units can bias cosmological constraints. We also analytically marginalize over zero-point errors in distance indicators, validate the accuracy of all our constraints using numerical simulations, and demonstrate how to combine different (correlated) velocity surveys using a matrix `hyperparameter' analysis. Current and forthcoming peculiar velocity surveys will allow us to understand in detail the growth of structure in the low-redshift universe, providing strong constraints on the nature of dark energy.},

	Abstract = {Dark energy has a dramatic effect on the dynamics of the Universe, causing the recently discovered acceleration of the expansion. The dynamics are also central to the behaviour of the growth of large-scale structure, offering the possibility that observations of structure formation provide a sensitive probe of the cosmology and dark energy characteristics. In particular, dark energy with a time-varying equation of state can have an influence on structure formation stretching back well into the matter-dominated epoch. We analyse this impact, first calculating the linear perturbation results, including those for weak gravitational lensing. These dynamical models possess definite observable differences from constant equation of state models. Then we present a large-scale numerical simulation of structure formation, including the largest volume to date involving a time-varying equation of state. We find the halo mass function is well described by the Jenkins et al. mass function formula. We also show how to interpret modifications of the Friedmann equation in terms of a time-variable equation of state. The results presented here provide steps toward realistic computation of the effect of dark energy in cosmological probes involving large-scale structure, such as cluster counts, the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect or weak gravitational lensing.},

However, this is at odds with the standard formalism based on the coupled-fluids approximation for the coevolution of dark matter and halos. Starting from conservation laws in phase space, we discuss why the fluid momentum conservation equation for the biased tracers needs to be modified in accordance with the change advocated in Baldauf et al. Our findings indicate that a correct description of the halo properties should properly take into account peak constraints when starting from the Vlasov-Boltzmann equation.},

	Abstract = {We develop a purely mathematical tool to recover some of the information lost in the nonlinear collapse of large-scale structure. From a set of 141 simulations of dark matter density fields, we construct a nonlinear Wiener filter in order to separate Gaussian and non-Gaussian structure in wavelet space. We find that the non-Gaussian power is dominant at smaller scales, as expected from the theory of structure formation, while the Gaussian counterpart is damped by an order of magnitude on small scales. We find that it is possible to increase the Fisher information by a factor of three before reaching the translinear plateau, an effect comparable to other techniques like the linear reconstruction of the density field.},

	Abstract = {We quantify the performance of a non-linear Wiener filter, constructed in wavelet space, at recovering some of the Fisher information that was lost in the weak lensing convergence field. The proposed method consists of a separation of the original field into the sum of a Gaussian and a non-Gaussian contribution. After filtering an ensemble of such fields, which are obtained from N-body simulations, we find that we can recapture about four times more Fisher information, an effect that can potentially improve by a significant amount the constraining power of weak lensing surveys on cosmological parameters, including the dark energy equation of state omega. We compare this performance with that of a logarithmic mapping and find that the wavelet method can recover up to three times more information.},

@article{Weinberg92,
	Abstract = {This paper describes a method for recovering primordial fluctuations from the present-day galaxy distribution, on the assumption that these fluctuations were Gaussian. The key element of the method is 'Gaussianization', a monotonic transformation of the smoothed galaxy distribution, which exploits the fact that gravitational evolution and biased galaxy formation tend to preserve the rank order of the initial density field. In tests on N-body simulations with known initial conditions, the reconstruction procedure recovers accurate maps of the initial fluctuations from fully sampled, sparsely sampled, or biased data. Evolution of the reconstructed initial conditions yields credible reproductions of the input data. Reconstruction analysis can be used to derive the properties of primordial fluctuations, to constrain biased galaxy formation and the value of Omega, and to test the hypotheses of gravitional instability and Gaussian primordial fluctuations.},

@article{Takada03,
	Abstract = {We use the halo model of clustering to compute two- and three-point correlation functions for weak lensing, and apply them in a new statistical technique to measure properties of massive haloes. We present analytical results on the eight shear three-point correlation functions constructed using a combination of the two shear components at each vertex of a triangle. We compare the amplitude and configuration dependence of the functions with ray-tracing simulations and find excellent agreement for different scales and models. These results are promising, since shear statistics are easier to measure than the convergence. In addition, the symmetry properties of the shear three-point functions provide a new and precise way of disentangling the lensing E mode from the B mode due to possible systematic errors.  We develop an approach based on correlation functions to measure the properties of galaxy-group and cluster haloes from lensing surveys. Shear correlations on small scales arise from the lensing matter within haloes of mass M>~ 1013 Msolar. Thus, the measurement of two- and three-point correlations can be used to extract information on halo density profiles, primarily the inner slope and halo concentration. We demonstrate the feasibility of such an analysis for forthcoming surveys. We include covariances in the correlation functions due to sample variance and intrinsic ellipticity noise to show that 10 per cent accuracy on profile parameters is achievable with surveys such as the CFHT Legacy survey, and significantly better with future surveys. Our statistical approach is complementary to the standard approach of identifying individual objects in survey data and measuring their properties. It can be extended to perform a combined analysis of the large-scale, perturbative regime down to small, subarcminute scales, to obtain consistent measurements of cosmological parameters and halo properties.},

@article{Takada04,
	Abstract = {We examine how lensing tomography with the bispectrum and power spectrum can constrain cosmological parameters and the equation of state of dark energy. Our analysis uses the full information at the two- and three-point level from angular scales of a few degrees to 5 arcmin (50 <=l<= 3000), which will be probed by lensing surveys. We use all triangle configurations, cross-power spectra and bispectra constructed from up to three redshift bins with photometric redshifts, and all relevant covariances in our analysis.  We find that the parameter constraints from bispectrum tomography are comparable to those from power spectrum tomography. Combining the two improves parameter accuracies by a factor of 3 due to their complementarity. For the dark energy parametrization w(a) =w0+wa(1 -a), the marginalized errors from lensing alone are sigma(w0) ~ 0.03f-1/2sky and sigma(wa) ~ 0.1 f-1/2sky. We show that these constraints can be further improved when combined with measurements of the cosmic microwave background or Type Ia supernovae. The amplitude and shape of the mass power spectrum are also shown to be precisely constrained. We use hyperextended perturbation theory to compute the non-linear lensing bispectrum for dark energy models. Accurate model predictions of the bispectrum in the moderately non-linear regime, calibrated with numerical simulations, will be needed to realize the parameter accuracy we have estimated. Finally, we estimate how well the lensing bispectrum can constrain a model with primordial non-Gaussianity.},

	Abstract = {Gravitational lensing of distant galaxies can be exploited to infer the convergence field as a function of angular position on the sky. The statistics of this field, much like that of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), can be studied to extract information about fundamental parameters in cosmology, most notably the dark energy in the universe. Unlike the CMB, the distribution of matter in the universe which determines the convergence field is highly non-Gaussian, reflecting the nonlinear processes that accompanied structure formation. Much of the cosmic information contained in the initial field is therefore unavailable to the standard power spectrum measurements. Here we propose a method for re-capturing cosmic information by using the power spectrum of a simple function of the observed (nonlinear) convergence field. We adapt the approach of Neyrinck et al. to lensing by using a modified logarithmic transform of the convergence field. The Fourier transform of the log-transformed field has modes that are nearly uncorrelated, which allows for additional cosmological information to be extracted from small-scale modes.},

	Abstract = {We use weak lensing data from the Hubble Space Telescope COSMOS survey to measure the second- and third-order moments of the cosmic shear field, estimated from about 450 000 galaxies with average redshift ?.  We measure two- and three-point shear statistics using a tree-code, dividing the signal in E, B and mixed components. We present a detection of the third-order moment of the aperture mass statistic and verify that the measurement is robust against systematic errors caused by point spread function (PSF) residuals and by the intrinsic alignments between galaxies. The amplitude of the measured three-point cosmic shear signal is in very good agreement with the predictions for a 7-yr Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP7) best-fitting model, whereas the amplitudes of potential systematics are consistent with zero.  We make use of three sets of large Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) simulations to test the accuracy of the cosmological predictions and to estimate the influence of the cosmology-dependent covariance.  We perform a likelihood analysis using the measurement of <M3ap> (theta) and find that the Omegam-sigma8 degeneracy direction is well fitted by the relation: sigma8(Omegam/0.30)0.49= 0.78+0.11-0.26 which is in good agreement with the best-fitting relation obtained by using the measurement of <M2ap> (theta): sigma8(Omegam/0.30)0.67= 0.70+0.11-0.14.  We present the first measurement of the more generalized three-point shear statistic <M3ap> (theta1, theta2, theta3) and find a very good agreement with the WMAP7 best-fitting cosmology. The cosmological interpretation of <M3ap> (theta1, theta2, theta3) gives sigma8(Omegam/0.30)0.46= 0.69+0.08-0.14. Furthermore, the combined likelihood analysis of <M3ap> (theta1, theta2, theta3) and <M2ap> (theta) improves the accuracy of the cosmological constraints to sigma8(Omegam/0.30)0.50= 0.69+0.07-0.12, showing the high potential of this combination of measurements to infer cosmological constraints. Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archives at the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility and the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of the Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {Any multivariate distribution can be uniquely decomposed into marginal (one-point) distributions, and a function called the copula, which contains all of the information on correlations between the distributions. The copula provides an important new methodology for analyzing the density field in large-scale structure. We derive the empirical two-point copula for the evolved dark matter density field. We find that this empirical copula is well approximated by a Gaussian copula. We consider the possibility that the full n-point copula is also Gaussian and describe some of the consequences of this hypothesis. Future directions for investigation are discussed.},

We introduce the copula, a mathematical tool to construct an arbitrary multivariate distribution function from one-dimensional marginal distribution functions with any given dependence structure. It is shown that a likelihood function constructed by the so-called Gaussian copula can reproduce very well the n-dimensional probability distribution of the cosmic shear power spectrum obtained from a large number of ray-tracing simulations. This suggests that the Copula likelihood will be a powerful tool for future weak lensing analyses, instead of the conventional multivariate Gaussian likelihood.},

	Abstract = {We use an ensemble of N-body simulations of the currently favoured (concordance) cosmological model to measure the amount of information contained in the non-linear matter power spectrum about the amplitude of the initial power spectrum. Two surprising results emerge from this study: (i) that there is very little independent information in the power spectrum in the translinear regime (k~= 0.2 -0.8hMpc-1 at the present day) over and above the information at linear scales; and (ii) that the cumulative information begins to rise sharply again with increasing wavenumber in the non-linear regime. In the fully non-linear regime, the simulations are consistent with no loss of information during translinear and non-linear evolution. If this is indeed the case then the results suggest a picture in which translinear collapse is very rapid, and is followed by a bounce prior to virialization, impelling a wholesale revision of the HKLM-Peacock & Dodds formalism.},

	Abstract = {We measure the covariance of the non-linear matter power spectrum from N-body simulations using two methods. In the first case, the covariance of power is estimated from the scatter over many random realizations of the density field. In the second, we use a novel technique to measure the covariance matrix from each simulation individually by re-weighting the density field with a carefully chosen set of functions. The two methods agree at linear scales, but unexpectedly they disagree substantially at increasingly non-linear scales. Moreover, the covariance of non-linear power measured using the re-weightings method changes with box size. The numerical results are consistent with an explanation given in a companion paper, which argues that the cause of the discrepancy is beat-coupling, in which products of Fourier modes separated by a small wavevector couple by gravitational growth to the large-scale beat mode between them. We calculate the information content of the non-linear power spectrum (about the amplitude of the initial, linear power spectrum) using both methods and confirm the result of a previous paper, that at translinear scales the power spectrum contains little information over and above that in the linear power spectrum, but that there is a marked increase in information at non-linear scales. We suggest that, in real galaxy surveys, the covariance of power at non-linear scales is likely to be dominated by beat-coupling to the largest scales of the survey and that, as a result, only part of the information potentially available at non-linear scales is actually measurable from real galaxy surveys.},

	Abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing is responsible for the shearing and magnification of the images of high-redshift sources due to the presence of intervening matter. The distortions are due to fluctuations in the gravitational potential, and are directly related to the distribution of matter and to the geometry and dynamics of the Universe. As a consequence, weak gravitational lensing offers unique possibilities for probing the Dark Matter and Dark Energy in the Universe. In this review, we summarise the theoretical and observational state of the subject, focussing on the statistical aspects of weak lensing, and consider the prospects for weak lensing surveys in the future. Weak gravitational lensing surveys are complementary to both galaxy surveys and cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations as they probe the unbiased non-linear matter power spectrum at modest redshifts. Most of the cosmological parameters are accurately estimated from CMB and large-scale galaxy surveys, so the focus of attention is shifting to understanding the nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. On the theoretical side, recent advances in the use of 3D information of the sources from photometric redshifts promise greater statistical power, and these are further enhanced by the use of statistics beyond two-point quantities such as the power spectrum. The use of 3D information also alleviates difficulties arising from physical effects such as the intrinsic alignment of galaxies, which can mimic weak lensing to some extent. On the observational side, in the next few years weak lensing surveys such as CFHTLS, VST-KIDS and Pan-STARRS, and the planned Dark Energy Survey, will provide the first weak lensing surveys covering very large sky areas and depth. In the long run even more ambitious programmes such as DUNE, the Supernova Anisotropy Probe (SNAP) and Large-aperture Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) are planned. Weak lensing of diffuse components such as the CMB and 21 cm emission can also provide valuable cosmological information. Finally, we consider the prospects for joint analysis with other probes, such as (1) the CMB to probe background cosmology (2) galaxy surveys to probe large-scale bias and (3) Sunyaev Zeldovich surveys to study small-scale baryonic physics, and consider the lensing effect on cosmological supernova observations.},

	Abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing provides a unique method to map directly the distribution of dark matter in the universe and to measure cosmological parameters. This cosmic-shear technique is based on the measurement of the weak distortions that lensing induces in the shape of background galaxies as photons travel through large-scale structures. This technique is now widely used to measure the mass distribution of galaxy clusters and has recently been detected in random regions of the sky. In this review, we present the theory and observational status of cosmic shear. We describe the principles of weak lensing and the predictions for the shear statistics in favored cosmological models. Next, we review the current measurements of cosmic shear and show how they constrain cosmological parameters. We then describe the prospects offered by upcoming and future cosmic-shear surveys as well as the technical challenges that have to be met for the promises of cosmic shear to be fully realized.},

@article{Pen03,
	Abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing provides a direct statistical measure of dark matter distribution. The variance is easiest to measure, which constrains the degenerate product sigma8Omega0.60. The degeneracy is broken by measuring the skewness arising from the fact that densities must remain positive, which is not possible when the initially symmetric perturbations become nonlinear. Skewness measures the nonlinear mass scale, which in combination with the variance measures Omega0 directly. We present the first detection of dark matter skewness from the VIRMOS-DESCART survey. We have measured the full three-point function and its projections onto windowed skewness. We separate the lensing mode and the B-mode. The lensing skewness is detected for a compensated Gaussian on scales of 5.37' to be kappa3=(1.06+/-0.06)×10-6. The B-modes are consistent with zero at this scale. The variance for the same window function is kappa2=(5.32+/-0.62+/-0.98)×10-5, resulting in S3=375+342-124. Comparing with N-body simulations, we find Omega0<0.5 at 90% confidence. The Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope legacy survey and newer simulations should be able to improve significantly on the constraint.},

	Abstract = {We find that, even in the presence of discreteness noise, a Gaussianizing transform (producing a more Gaussian one-point distribution) reduces nonlinearities in the power spectra of cosmological matter and galaxy density fields, in many cases drastically. Although Gaussianization does increase the effective shot noise, it also increases the power spectrum's fidelity to the linear power spectrum on scales where the shot noise is negligible. Gaussianizing also increases the Fisher information in the power spectrum in all cases and resolutions, although the gains are smaller in redshift space than in real space. We also find that the gain in cumulative Fisher information from Gaussianizing peaks at a particular grid resolution depends on the sampling level.},

	Abstract = {Ordinary baryonic particles (such as protons and neutrons) account for only one-sixth of the total matter in the Universe. The remainder is a mysterious `dark matter' component, which does not interact via electromagnetism and thus neither emits nor reflects light. As dark matter cannot be seen directly using traditional observations, very little is currently known about its properties. It does interact via gravity, and is most effectively probed through gravitational lensing: the deflection of light from distant galaxies by the gravitational attraction of foreground mass concentrations. This is a purely geometrical effect that is free of astrophysical assumptions and sensitive to all matter-whether baryonic or dark. Here we show high-fidelity maps of the large-scale distribution of dark matter, resolved in both angle and depth. We find a loose network of filaments, growing over time, which intersect in massive structures at the locations of clusters of galaxies. Our results are consistent with predictions of gravitationally induced structure formation, in which the initial, smooth distribution of dark matter collapses into filaments then into clusters, forming a gravitational scaffold into which gas can accumulate, and stars can be built.},

	Abstract = {Gaussianizing the one-point distribution of the weak gravitational lensing convergence has recently been shown to increase the signal-to-noise ratio contained in two-point statistics. We investigate the information on cosmology that can be extracted from the transformed convergence fields. Employing Box-Cox transformations to determine optimal transformations to Gaussianity, we develop analytical models for the transformed power spectrum, including effects of noise and smoothing. We find that optimized Box-Cox transformations perform substantially better than an offset logarithmic transformation in Gaussianizing the convergence, but both yield very similar results for the signal-to-noise ratio. None of the transformations is capable of eliminating correlations of the power spectra between different angular frequencies, which we demonstrate to have a significant impact on the errors in cosmology. Analytic models of the Gaussianized power spectrum yield good fits to the simulations and produce unbiased parameter estimates in the majority of cases, where the exceptions can be traced back to the limitations in modelling the higher order correlations of the original convergence. In the ideal case, without galaxy shape noise, we find an increase in the cumulative signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 2.6 for angular frequencies up to l= 1500, and a decrease in the area of the confidence region in the Omegam-sigma8 plane, measured in terms of q-values, by a factor of 4.4 for the best performing transformation. When adding a realistic level of shape noise, all transformations perform poorly with little decorrelation of angular frequencies, a maximum increase in signal-to-noise ratio of 34 per cent, and even slightly degraded errors on cosmological parameters. We argue that to find Gaussianizing transformations of practical use, it will be necessary to go beyond transformations of the one-point distribution of the convergence, extend the analysis deeper into the non-linear regime and resort to an exploration of parameter space via simulations.},

@article{Hui99,
	Abstract = {Using perturbation theory, Bernardeau, Van Waerbeke, & Mellier show that the skewness of the large-scale lensing convergence, or projected mass density, could be used to constrain Omegam, the matter content of the universe. However, deep weak-lensing field surveys in the near future will likely measure the convergence on small angular scales (<~10'), where the signal will be dominated by highly nonlinear fluctuations. We develop a method for computing the small-scale convergence skewness that gives predictions that agree well with existing results from ray-tracing N-body simulations but is significantly faster. We demonstrate that the small-scale convergence skewness is insensitive to the shape and normalization of the primordial (cold dark matter-type) power spectrum, making it dependent almost entirely on the cosmological energy contents. Moreover, nonlinear clustering appears to enhance the differences between predictions of the convergence skewness for a range of models. Hence, in addition to constraining Omegam, the small-scale convergence skewness from future deep and several degrees wide surveys can be used to differentiate between curvature-dominated and cosmological constant (Lambda)-dominated models, as well as to constrain the equation of state of a quintessence component, thereby distinguishing Lambda from quintessence. Finally, our method can be easily generalized to other measures such as the aperture mass statistics.},

Furthermore, the measurement of the weak lensing induced distortions of the shapes of distant galaxies is a potentially powerful probe of dark energy. In this review we discuss how this challenging measurement is made and interpreted. We describe the various systematic effects that can hamper progress and how they may be overcome. We review some of the recent results in weak lensing by galaxies, galaxy clusters, and cosmic shear and discuss the prospects for dark energy measurements from planned surveys.},

We start from the full second order metric, including scalar, vector, and tensor perturbations, and retain all relevant contributions to the cosmic shear corrections that are second order in the gravitational potential. The relevant terms are: the nonlinear evolution of the scalar gravitational potential, the Born correction, and lens-lens coupling. No other second order terms contribute appreciably to the lensing signal. Since ray-tracing algorithms currently include these three effects, this derivation serves as rigorous justification for the numerical predictions.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the effect of non-Gaussianity on the reconstruction of the initial mass field from the Lyalpha forest. We show that the transmitted flux of QSO absorption spectra are highly non-Gaussian in terms of the statistics, the kurtosis spectrum, and the scale-scale correlation. These non-Gaussianities cannot be completely removed by the conventional algorithm of Gaussianization, and the scale-scale correlations are largely retained in the mass field recovered by the Gaussian mapping. Therefore, the mass power spectrum recovered by the conventional algorithm is systematically lower than the initial mass spectrum on scales at which the local scale-scale correlation is substantial. To reduce the non-Gaussian contamination, we present two methods. The first is to perform the Gaussianization scale-by-scale using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposition. We show that the non-Gaussian features of the Lyalpha forest basically will no longer exist in the scale-by-scale Gaussianized mass field. The second method is to choose a proper orthonormal basis (representation) to suppress the effect of the non-Gaussian correlations. In the quasi-linear regime of cosmic structure formation, the DWT power spectrum is efficient for suppressing the non-Gaussian contamination. These two methods significantly improve the recovery of the mass power spectrum from the Lyalpha forest.},

While much attention to date has focused on the two-point-function of the cosmic shear, the three-point-function, the bispectrum, also contains very useful cosmological information. Here, we compute three corrections to the bispectrum which are nominally of the same order as the leading term. We show that the corrections are small, so they can be ignored when analyzing present surveys.

	Abstract = {A large fraction of cosmological information on dark energy and gravity is encoded in the nonlinear regime. Precision cosmology thus requires precision modeling of nonlinearities in general dark energy and modified gravity models. We modify the Gadget-2 code and run a series of N-body simulations on modified gravity cosmology to study the nonlinearities. The modified gravity model that we investigate in the present paper is characterized by a single parameter zeta, which determines the enhancement of particle acceleration with respect to general relativity (GR), given the identical mass distribution (zeta=1 in GR). The first nonlinear statistics we investigate is the nonlinear matter power spectrum at k≲3h/Mpc, which is the relevant range for robust weak lensing power spectrum modeling at l≲2000. In this study, we focus on the relative difference in the nonlinear power spectra at corresponding redshifts where different gravity models have the same linear power spectra. This particular statistics highlights the imprint of modified gravity in the nonlinear regime and the importance of including the nonlinear regime in testing GR. By design, it is less susceptible to the sample variance and numerical artifacts. We adopt a mass assignment method based on wavelet to improve the power spectrum measurement. We run a series of tests to determine the suitable simulation specifications (particle number, box size, and initial redshift). We find that, the nonlinear power spectra can differ by ˜30% for 10% deviation from GR (|zeta-1|=0.1) where the rms density fluctuations reach 10. This large difference, on one hand, shows the richness of information on gravity in the corresponding scales, and on the other hand, invalidates simple extrapolations of some existing fitting formulae to modified gravity cosmology.},

	Abstract = {We review the formalism and applications of non-linear perturbation theory (PT) to understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe. We first discuss the dynamics of gravitational instability, from the linear to the non-linear regime. This includes Eulerian and Lagrangian PT, non-linear approximations, and a brief description of numerical simulation techniques. We then cover the basic statistical tools used in cosmology to describe cosmic fields, such as correlation functions in real and Fourier space, probability distribution functions, cumulants and generating functions. In subsequent sections we review the use of PT to make quantitative predictions about these statistics according to initial conditions, including effects of possible non-Gaussianity of the primordial fields. Results are illustrated by detailed comparisons of PT predictions with numerical simulations. The last sections deal with applications to observations. First, we review in detail practical estimators of statistics in galaxy catalogs and related errors, including traditional approaches and more recent developments. Then, we consider the effects of the bias between the galaxy distribution and the matter distribution, the treatment of redshift distortions in three-dimensional surveys and of projection effects in angular catalogs, and some applications to weak gravitational lensing. We finally review the current observational situation regarding statistics in galaxy catalogs and what the future generation of galaxy surveys promises to deliver.},

	Abstract = {We have detected non-Gaussian signatures in the VIRMOS-DESCART weak lensing survey from a measurement of the three-point shear correlation function, following the method developed by Bernardeau et al. (2002). We obtain a 2.4sigma signal over four independent angular bins, or equivalently, a 4.9-sigma confidence level detection with respect to measurements errors on scale of about 2 to 4 arcmin. The amplitude and the shape of the signal are consistent with theoretical expectations obtained from ray-tracing simulations. This result supports the idea that the measure corresponds to a cosmological signal due to the gravitational instability dynamics. Its properties could be used to put constraints on the cosmological parameters, in particular on the density parameter of the Universe, but the error level as well as the cosmic variance are still too large to permit secure conclusions. Based on observations obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council of Canada (NRCC), the Institut des Sciences de l'Univers (INSU) of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and the University of Hawaii (UH).},

@article{Bernardeau97,
	Abstract = {The possibility of detecting weak lensing effects from deep wide field imaging surveys has opened new means of probing the large-scale structure of the Universe and measuring cosmological parameters. In this paper we present a systematic study of the expected dependence of the low order moments of the filtered gravitational local convergence on the power spectrum of the density fluctuations and on the cosmological parameters {OMEGA}_0_ and {LAMBDA}. The results show a significant dependence on all these parameters. Though we note that this degeneracy could be partially raised by considering two populations of sources, at different redshifts, computing the third moment is more promising since it is expected, in the quasi-linear regime and for Gaussian initial conditions, to be only {OMEGA}_0_ dependent (with a slight degeneracy with {LAMBDA}) when it is correctly expressed in terms of the second moment. More precisely we show that the variance of the convergence varies approximately as P(k){OMEGA}_0_^1.5^z_s_^1.5^, whereas the skewness varies as {OMEGA}_0_^-0.8^z_s_^-1.35^, where P(k) is the projected power spectrum and z_s_ the redshift of the sources. Thus, used jointly they can provide both P(k) and {OMEGA}_0_. However, the dependence on the redshift of the sources is large and could be a major concern for a practical implementation. We have estimated the errors expected for these parameters in a realistic scenario and sketched what would be the observational requirements for doing such measurements. A more detailed study of an observational strategy is left for a second paper.},

	Abstract = {Weak-lensing measurements are starting to provide statistical maps of the distribution of matter in the universe that are increasingly precise and complementary to cosmic microwave background maps. The probability distribution function (PDF) provides a powerful tool to test non-Gaussian features in the convergence field and to discriminate the different cosmological models. In this paper, we present a new PDF space Wiener filter approach to reconstruct the probability density function of the convergence from the noisy convergence field. We find that for parameters comparable to the CFHT Legacy Survey, the averaged PDF of the convergence in a 3$\,^{\circ}$ field can be reconstructed with an uncertainty of about 10%, although the pointwise PDF is noise dominated.},

	Abstract = {A logarithmic transform of the convergence field improves "the information content," i.e., the overall precision associated with the measurement of the amplitude of the convergence power spectrum, by improving the covariance matrix properties. The translation of this improvement in the information content to that in cosmological parameters, such as those associated with dark energy, requires knowing the sensitivity of the log-transformed field to those cosmological parameters. In this paper, we use N-body simulations with ray tracing to generate convergence fields at multiple source redshifts as a function of cosmology. The gain in information associated with the log-transformed field does lead to tighter constraints on dark energy parameters, but only if shape noise is neglected. The presence of shape noise quickly diminishes the advantage of the log-mapping, more quickly than we would expect based on the information content. With or without shape noise, using a larger pixel size allows for a more efficient log-transformation.},

	Abstract = {The matter density field exhibits a nearly lognormal probability density distribution after entering into the nonlinear regime. Recently, it has been shown that the shape of the power spectrum of a logarithmically transformed density field is very close to the linear density power spectrum, motivating an analytic study of it. In this paper, we develop cosmological perturbation theory for the power spectrum of this field. Our formalism is developed in the context of renormalized perturbation theory, which helps to regulate the convergence behavior of the perturbation series, and of the Taylor series expansion we use for the logarithmic mapping. This approach allows us to handle the critical issue of density smoothing in a straightforward way. We also compare our perturbative results with simulation measurements.},

@article{Neyrinck11c,
	Abstract = {It was recently shown that applying a Gaussianizing transform, such as a logarithm, to the nonlinear matter density field extends the range of useful applicability of the power spectrum by a factor of a few smaller. Such a transform dramatically reduces nonlinearities in both the covariance and the shape of the power spectrum. Here, analyzing Coyote Universe real-space dark-matter density fields, we investigate the consequences of these transforms for cosmological parameter estimation. The power spectrum of the log-density provides the tightest cosmological parameter error bars (marginalized or not), giving a factor of 2-3 improvement over the conventional power spectrum in all five parameters tested. For the tilt, ns , the improvement reaches a factor of five. Similar constraints are achieved if the log-density power spectrum and conventional power spectrum are analyzed together. Rank-order Gaussianization seems just as useful as a log transform to constrain ns , but not other parameters. Dividing the overdensity by its dispersion in few-Mpc cells, while it diagonalizes the covariance matrix, does not seem to help with parameter constraints. We also provide a code that emulates these power spectra over a range of concordance cosmological models.},

@article{Carron12b,
	Abstract = {Using fits to numerical simulations, we show that the entire hierarchy of moments quickly ceases to provide a complete description of the convergence one-point probability density function leaving the linear regime. This suggests that the full N-point correlation function hierarchy of the convergence field becomes quickly generically incomplete and a very poor cosmological probe on nonlinear scales. At the scale of unit variance, only 5% of the Fisher information content of the one-point probability density function is still contained in its hierarchy of moments, making clear that information escaping the hierarchy is a far stronger effect than information propagating to higher order moments. It follows that the constraints on cosmological parameters achievable through extraction of the entire hierarchy become suboptimal by large amounts. A simple logarithmic mapping makes the moment hierarchy well suited again for parameter extraction.},

	Abstract = {Because of mass assignment onto grid points in the measurement of the power spectrum using a fast Fourier transform (FFT), the raw power spectrum <|deltaf(k)|2> estimated with the FFT is not the same as the true power spectrum P(k). In this paper we derive a formula that relates <|deltaf(k)|2> to P(k). For a sample of N discrete objects, the formula reads <|deltaf(k)|2>=Sigman[|W(k+2kNn)|2P(k+2kNn)+1/N|W(k+2kNn)|2], where W(k) is the Fourier transform of the mass assignment function W(r), kN is the Nyquist wavenumber, and n is an integer vector. The formula is different from that in some previous works in which the summation over n is neglected. For the nearest grid point, cloud-in-cell, and triangular-shaped cloud assignment functions, we show that the shot-noise term Sigman(1/N)|W(k+2kNn)|2 can be expressed by simple analytical functions. To reconstruct P(k) from the alias sum Sigman|W(k+2kNn)|2P(k+2kNn), we propose an iterative method. We test the method by applying it to an N-body simulation sample and show that the method can successfully recover P(k). The discussion is further generalized to samples with observational selection effects.},

	Abstract = {Motivated by recent results on lognormal statistics showing that the moment hierarchy of a lognormal variable completely fails at capturing its information content in the large variance regime, in this work we discuss the inadequacy of the hierarchy of correlation functions to describe a correlated lognormal field, which provides a roughly accurate description of the nonlinear cosmological matter density field. We present families of fields having the same hierarchy of correlation functions than the lognormal field at all orders. This explicitly demonstrates the little studied though known fact that the correlation function hierarchy never provides a complete description of a lognormal field, and that it fails to capture information in the nonlinear regime, where other simple observables are left totally unconstrained. We discuss why perturbative, Edgeworth-like approaches to statistics in the nonlinear regime, common in cosmology, can never reproduce or predict that effect, and why it is, however, generic for tailed fields, hinting at a breakdown of the perturbation theory based on the field fluctuations. We make a rough but successful quantitative connection to N-body simulations results that showed that the spectrum of the log-density field carries more information than the spectrum of the field entering the nonlinear regime.},

	Abstract = {We trace with analytical methods and in a model parameter-independent manner the independent bits of Fisher information of each of the moments of the lognormal distribution as a now standard prescription for the distribution of the cosmological matter density field as it departs from Gaussian initial conditions. We show that, when entering the regime of large fluctuations, only a tiny, dramatically decaying fraction of the total information content remains accessible through the extraction of the full series of moments of the field. This is due to the known peculiarity of highly tailed distributions that they cannot be uniquely recovered given the values of all of their moments. Under this lognormal assumption, cosmological probes such as the correlation function hierarchy or, equivalently, their Fourier transforms, are rendered fundamentally limited once the field becomes nonlinear, for any parameter of interest. We show that the fraction of the information accessible from two-point correlations decays to zero following the inverse squared variance of the field. We discuss what general properties of a random field's probability density function are making the correlation function hierarchy an efficient or inefficient, complete or incomplete, set of probes of any model parameter.},

@article{Kitaura12,
	Abstract = {We propose a new method to linearize cosmological mass density fields using higher order Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT). We demonstrate that a given density field can be expressed as the sum of a linear and a non-linear component which are tightly coupled to each other by the tidal field tensor within the LPT framework. The linear component corresponds to the initial density field in Eulerian coordinates, and its mean relation with the total field can be approximated by a logarithm (giving theoretical support to recent attempts to find such a component). We also propose to use a combination of the linearization method and the continuity equation to find the mapping between Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates. In addition, we note that this method opens the possibility of using directly higher order LPT on non-linear fields. We test our linearization scheme by applying it to the z ˜ 0.5 density field from an N-body simulation. We find that the linearized version of the full density field can be successfully recovered on ≳5 h-1 Mpc, reducing the skewness and kurtosis of the distribution by about one and two orders of magnitude, respectively. This component can also be successfully traced back in time, converging towards the initial unevolved density field at z ˜ 100. We anticipate a number of applications of our results, from predicting velocity fields to estimates of the initial conditions of the Universe, passing by improved constraints on cosmological parameters derived from galaxy clustering via reconstruction methods.},

	Abstract = {We find a simple, accurate model for the covariance matrix of the real-space cosmological matter power spectrum on slightly nonlinear scales (k ~ 0.1-0.8 h Mpc-1 at z = 0), where off-diagonal matrix elements become substantial. The model includes a multiplicative, scale-independent modulation of the power spectrum. It has only one parameter, the variance (among realizations) of the variance of the nonlinear density field in cells, with little dependence on the cell size between 2 and 8 h -1 Mpc. Furthermore, we find that this extra covariance can be modeled out by instead measuring the power spectrum of delta/sigmacell, i.e., the ratio of the overdensity to its dispersion in grid cells. Dividing delta by sigmacell essentially removes the non-Gaussian part of the covariance matrix, nearly diagonalizing it.},

@article{Hilbert11,
	Abstract = {Context. Accurate estimates of the errors on the cosmological parameters inferred from cosmic shear surveys require accurate estimates of the covariance of the cosmic shear correlation functions.  Aims: We seek approximations to the cosmic shear covariance that are as easy to use as the common approximations based on normal (Gaussian) statistics, but yield more accurate covariance matrices and parameter errors.  Methods: We derive expressions for the cosmic shear covariance under the assumption that the underlying convergence field follows log-normal statistics. We also derive a simplified version of this log-normal approximation by only retaining the most important terms beyond normal statistics. We use numerical simulations of weak lensing to study how well the normal, log-normal, and simplified log-normal approximations as well as empirical corrections to the normal approximation proposed in the literature reproduce shear covariances for cosmic shear surveys. We also investigate the resulting confidence regions for cosmological parameters inferred from such surveys.  Results: We find that the normal approximation substantially underestimates the cosmic shear covariances and the inferred parameter confidence regions, in particular for surveys with small fields of view and large galaxy densities, but also for very wide surveys. In contrast, the log-normal approximation yields more realistic covariances and confidence regions, but also requires evaluating slightly more complicated expressions. However, the simplified log-normal approximation, although as simple as the normal approximation, yields confidence regions that are almost as accurate as those obtained from the log-normal approximation. The empirical corrections to the normal approximation do not yield more accurate covariances and confidence regions than the (simplified) log-normal approximation. Moreover, they fail to produce positive-semidefinite data covariance matrices in certain cases, rendering them unusable for parameter estimation.  Conclusions: The log-normal or simplified log-normal approximation should be used in favour of the normal approximation for parameter estimation and parameter error forecasts. More generally, any approximation to the cosmic shear covariance should ensure a positive-(semi)definite data covariance matrix.},

@article{Kitaura13a,
	Abstract = {I present a new approach to recover the primordial density fluctuations and the cosmic web structure underlying a galaxy distribution. The method is based on sampling Gaussian fields which are compatible with a galaxy distribution and a structure formation model. This is achieved by splitting the inversion problem into two Gibbs-sampling steps: the first being a Gaussianization step transforming a distribution of point sources at Lagrangian positions - which are not a priori given- into a linear alias-free Gaussian field. This step is based on Hamiltonian sampling with a Gaussian-Poisson model. The second step consists on a likelihood comparison in which the set of matter tracers at the initial conditions is constrained on the galaxy distribution and the assumed structure formation model. For computational reasons second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory is used. However, the presented approach is flexible to adopt any structure formation model. A semi-analytic halo-model-based galaxy mock catalogue is taken to demonstrate that the recovered initial conditions are closely unbiased with respect to the actual ones from the corresponding N-body simulation down to scales of a ˜5 Mpc h-1. The cross-correlation between them shows a substantial gain of information, being at k ˜ 0.3 h Mpc-1 more than doubled. In addition the initial conditions are extremely well Gaussian distributed and the power spectra follow the shape of the linear power spectrum being very close to the actual one from the simulation down to scales of k ˜ 1 h Mpc-1.},

	Abstract = {In paper I (Yu et al. ), we showed through N-body simulation that a local monotonic Gaussian transformation can significantly reduce non-Gaussianity in a noise-free lensing convergence field. This makes the Gaussianization a promising theoretical tool to understand high-order lensing statistics. Here we present a study of its applicability in lensing data analysis, in particular when shape measurement noise is presented in lensing convergence maps. (i) We find that shape measurement noise significantly degrades the Gaussianization performance and the degradation increases for shallower surveys. (ii) The Wiener filter is efficient in reducing the impact of shape measurement noise. The Gaussianization of the Wiener-filtered lensing maps is able to suppress skewness, kurtosis, and the 5th- and 6th-order cumulants by a factor of 10 or more. It also works efficiently to reduce the bispectrum to zero.},

@article{Neyrinck13,
	Abstract = {We present an experiment in which we `ring' a set of cosmological N-body- simulation initial conditions, placing spikes in the initial power spectrum at different wavenumber bins. We then measure where these spikes end up in the final conditions. In the usual overdensity power spectrum, most sensitive to contracting and collapsing dense regions, initial power on slightly non-linear scales (k ˜ 0.3 h Mpc-1) smears to smaller scales, coming to dominate the initial power once there. Log-density and Gaussianized-density power spectra, sensitive to low-density (expanding) and high-density regions, respond differently: initial spikes spread symmetrically in scale, both upwards and downwards. In fact, in the power spectrum of 1/(1 + delta), spikes migrate to larger scales, showing the magnifying effect of voids on small-scale modes. These power spectra show much greater sensitivity to small-scale initial features. We also test the difference between an approximation of the Lyalpha flux field and its Gaussianized form, and give a toy model that qualitatively explains the symmetric power spreading in Gaussianized-density power spectra. Also, we discuss how to use this framework to estimate power-spectrum covariance matrices. This can be used to track the fate of information in the Universe that takes the form of initial degrees of freedom, one random spike per initial mode.},

@article{Carron13,
	Abstract = {Recently, several studies proposed non-linear transformations, such as a logarithmic or Gaussianization transformation, as efficient tools to recapture information about the (Gaussian) initial conditions. During non-linear evolution, part of the cosmologically relevant information leaks out from the second moment of the distribution. This information is accessible only through complex higher order moments or, in the worst case, becomes inaccessible to the hierarchy. The focus of this work is to investigate these transformations in the framework of Fisher information using cosmological perturbation theory of the matter field with Gaussian initial conditions. We show that at each order in perturbation theory, there is a polynomial of corresponding order exhausting the information on a given parameter. This polynomial can be interpreted as the Taylor expansion of the maximally efficient `sufficient' observable in the non-linear regime. We determine explicitly this maximally efficient observable for local transformations. Remarkably, this optimal transform is essentially the simple power transform with an exponent related to the slope of the power spectrum; when this is -1, it is indistinguishable from the logarithmic transform. This transform Gaussianizes the distribution, and recovers the linear density contrast. Thus a direct connection is revealed between undoing of the non-linear dynamics and the efficient capture of Fisher information. Our analytical results were compared with measurements from the Millennium Simulation density field. We found that our transforms remain very close to optimal even in the deeply non-linear regime with sigma2 ˜ 10.},

	Abstract = {We examine and combine different techniques that are known to increase the Fisher information content about the amplitude of the matter power spectrum, and propagate their impact on a baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurement. We compare a density reconstruction algorithm based on Zel'dovich displacement fields, a wavelet non-linear Wiener filter, a direct Gaussianization of the probability distribution function of the wavelet function coefficients and the action of the last two techniques on the first one. From a series of 200 N-body simulations, we compute the Fisher information and quantify the recovery performance, both using dark matter particles and haloes. We find that the height of the Fisher information trans-linear plateau is generally increased by the various techniques, by up to an order of magnitude at k = 0.6 h Mpc-1; however, shot noise subtracted halo measurements exhibit a milder information recovery. When we perform a BAO measurement from these altered density fields, we find that the reconstruction technique is the only one that sharpens the peak; the two wavelet-based techniques in fact smear out the features, thus reducing the overall precision of the cosmological ladder. We examine in detail why this occurs even though their Fisher information increased.},

@article{Leclercq13,
	Abstract = {On the smallest scales, three-dimensional large-scale structure surveys contain a wealth of cosmological information which cannot be trivially extracted due to the non-linear dynamical evolution of the density field. Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) is widely applied to the generation of mock halo catalogs and data analysis. In this work, we compare topological features of the cosmic web such as voids, sheets, filaments and clusters, in the density fields predicted by LPT and full numerical simulation of gravitational large-scale structure formation. We propose a method designed to improve the correspondence between these density fields, in the mildly non-linear regime. We develop a computationally fast and flexible tool for a variety of cosmological applications. Our method is based on a remapping of the approximately-evolved density field, using information extracted from N-body simulations. The remapping procedure consists of replacing the one-point distribution of the density contrast by one which better accounts for the full gravitational dynamics. As a result, we obtain a physically more pertinent density field on a point-by-point basis, while also improving higher-order statistics predicted by LPT. We quantify the approximation error in the power spectrum and in the bispectrum as a function of scale and redshift. Our remapping procedure improves one-, two- and three-point statistics at scales down to 8 Mpc/h.},

	Abstract = {Beyond the linear regime, the power spectrum and higher order moments of the matter field no longer capture all cosmological information encoded in density fluctuations. While non-linear transforms have been proposed to extract this information lost to traditional methods, up to now, the way to generalize these techniques to discrete processes was unclear; ad hoc extensions had some success. We pointed out in Carron and Szapudi's paper that the logarithmic transform approximates extremely well the optimal `sufficient statistics', observables that extract all information from the (continuous) matter field. Building on these results, we generalize optimal transforms to discrete galaxy fields. We focus our calculations on the Poisson sampling of an underlying lognormal density field. We solve and test the one-point case in detail, and sketch out the sufficient observables for the multipoint case. Moreover, we present an accurate approximation to the sufficient observables in terms of the mean and spectrum of a non-linearly transformed field. We find that the corresponding optimal non-linear transformation is directly related to the maximum a posteriori Bayesian reconstruction of the underlying continuous field with a lognormal prior as put forward in the paper of Kitaura et al.. Thus, simple recipes for realizing the sufficient observables can be built on previously proposed algorithms that have been successfully implemented and tested in simulations.},

	Abstract = {We provide generic predictions for the lower order cumulants of weak lensing maps, and their correlators for tomographic bins as well as in three dimensions (3D). Using small-angle approximation, we derive the corresponding one- and two-point probability distribution function for the tomographic maps from different bins and for 3D convergence maps. The modelling of weak lensing statistics is obtained by adopting a detailed prescription for the underlying density contrast that involves hierarchal ansatz and lognormal distribution. We study the dependence of our results on cosmological parameters and source distributions corresponding to the realistic surveys such as LSST and DES. We briefly outline how photometric redshift information can be incorporated in our results. We also show how topological properties of convergence maps can be quantified using our results.},

	Abstract = {Motivated by recent works of Neyrinck et al. 2009 and Scherrer et al. 2010, we proposed a Gaussian transformation to Gaussianize the non-Gaussian lensing convergence field kappa. It performs a local monotonic transformation kappa-->y pixel by pixel to make the fine-scale one-point probability distribution function of the new variable y Gaussian. We tested whether the whole y field is Gaussian through N-body simulations. (1) We found that the proposed Gaussianization suppresses the non-Gaussianity by orders of magnitude, in measures of the skewness, the kurtosis, the 5th- and 6th-order cumulants of the y field smoothed over various angular scales, relative to that of the corresponding smoothed kappa field. The residual non-Gaussianities are often consistent with zero within the statistical errors. (2) The Gaussianization significantly suppresses the bispectrum. Furthermore, the residual scatters about zero, depending on the configuration in the Fourier space. (3) The Gaussianization works with even better performance for the 2D fields of the matter density projected over ˜300h-1Mpc distance interval centered at z∈(0,2), which can be reconstructed from the weak lensing tomography. (4) We identified imperfectness and complexities of the proposed Gaussianization. We noticed weak residual non-Gaussianity in the y field. We verified the widely used logarithmic transformation as a good approximation to the Gaussian transformation. However, we also found noticeable deviations.},

	Abstract = {We explore the benefits of using a passively evolving population of galaxies to measure the evolution of the rate of structure growth between z = 0.25 and 0.65 by combining data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) I/II and SDSS-III surveys. The large-scale linear bias of a population of dynamically passive galaxies, which we select from both surveys, is easily modelled. Knowing the bias evolution breaks degeneracies inherent to other methodologies, and decreases the uncertainty in measurements of the rate of structure growth and the normalization of the galaxy power spectrum by up to a factor of 2. If we translate our measurements into a constraint on sigma8(z = 0) assuming a concordance cosmological model and general relativity (GR), we find that using a bias model improves our uncertainty by a factor of nearly 1.5. Our results are consistent with a flat Lambda cold dark matter model and with GR.},

	Abstract = {We analyse the anisotropic clustering of massive galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 9 (DR9) sample, which consists of 264 283 galaxies in the redshift range 0.43 < z < 0.7 spanning 3275 deg2. Both peculiar velocities and errors in the assumed redshift-distance relation ('Alcock-Paczynski effect') generate correlations between clustering amplitude and orientation with respect to the line of sight. Together with the sharp baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) standard ruler, our measurements of the broad-band shape of the monopole and quadrupole correlation functions simultaneously constrain the comoving angular diameter distance (2190 $\pm$ 61 Mpc) to z = 0.57, the Hubble expansion rate at z = 0.57 (92.4 $\pm$ 4.5 km s-1 Mpc-1) and the growth rate of structure at that same redshift (dsigma8/d ln a = 0.43 $\pm$ 0.069). Our analysis provides the best current direct determination of both DA and H in galaxy clustering data using this technique. If we further assume a Lambdacold dark matter expansion history, our growth constraint tightens to dsigma8/d ln a = 0.415 $\pm$ 0.034. In combination with the cosmic microwave background, our measurements of DA, H and dsigma8/d ln a all separately require dark energy at z > 0.57, and when combined imply OmegaLambda = 0.74 $\pm$ 0.016, independent of the Universe's evolution at z < 0.57. All of these constraints assume scale-independent linear growth, and assume general relativity to compute both O(10 per cent) non-linear model corrections and our errors. In our companion paper, Samushia et al., we explore further cosmological implications of these observations.},

	Abstract = {We study the generation of vorticity and velocity dispersion by orbit crossing using cosmological numerical simulations, and calculate the backreaction of these effects on the evolution of large-scale density and velocity divergence power spectra. We use Delaunay tessellations to define the velocity field, showing that the power spectra of velocity divergence and vorticity measured in this way are unbiased and have better noise properties than for standard interpolation methods that deal with mass-weighted velocities. We show that high resolution simulations are required to recover the correct large-scale vorticity power spectrum, while poor resolution can spuriously amplify its amplitude by more than 1 order of magnitude. We measure the scalar and vector modes of the stress tensor induced by orbit crossing using an adaptive technique, showing that its vector modes lead, when input into the vorticity evolution equation, to the same vorticity power spectrum obtained from the Delaunay method. We incorporate orbit-crossing corrections to the evolution of large-scale density and velocity fields in perturbation theory by using the measured stress tensor modes. We find that at large scales (k~=0.1hMpc-1) vector modes have very little effect in the density power spectrum, while scalar modes (velocity dispersion) can induce percent-level corrections at z=0, particularly in the velocity divergence power spectrum. In addition, we show that the velocity power spectrum is smaller than predicted by linear theory until well into the nonlinear regime, with little contribution from virial velocities.},

	Abstract = {Massive spectroscopic redshift surveys open a promising window to accurately measure peculiar velocity at cosmological distances through redshift space distortion (RSD). In Paper I Zhang et al. [Phys. Rev. D 87, 063526 (2013)] of this series of work, we proposed decomposing peculiar velocity into three eigenmodes (vdelta, vS, and vB) in order to facilitate the RSD modeling and peculiar velocity reconstruction. In the current paper we measure the dark matter RSD-related statistics of the velocity eigenmodes through a set of N-body simulations. These statistics include the velocity power spectra, correlation functions, one-point probability distribution functions, cumulants, and the damping functions describing the Finger of God effect. We have carried out a number of tests to quantify possible numerical artifacts in these measurements and have confirmed that these numerical artifacts are under control. Our major findings are as follows: (1) The power spectrum measurement shows that these velocity components have distinctly different spatial distribution and redshift evolution, consistent with predictions in Paper I. In particular, we measure the window function W˜(k,z). W˜ describes the impact of nonlinear evolution on the vdelta-density relation. We confirm that the approximation W˜=1 can induce a significant systematic error of O(10%) in RSD cosmology. We demonstrate that W˜ can be accurately described by a simple fitting formula with one or two free parameters. (2) The correlation function measurement shows that the correlation length is O(100), O(10), and O(1)Mpc for vdelta, vS, and vB, respectively. These correlation lengths determine where we can treat the velocity fields as spatially uncorrelated. Hence, they are important properties in RSD modeling. (3) The velocity probability distribution functions and cumulants quantify non-Gaussianities of the velocity fields. We confirm speculation in Paper I that vdelta is largely Gaussian, but with non-negligible non-Gaussianity. We confirm that vB is significantly non-Gaussian. We also measure the damping functions. Despite the observed non-Gaussianities, the damping functions and hence the Finger of God effect are all well approximated as Gaussian ones at scales of interest.},

	Abstract = {Massive spectroscopic surveys will measure the redshift space distortion (RSD) induced by galaxy peculiar velocity to unprecedented accuracy and open a new era of precision RSD cosmology. We develop a new method to improve the RSD modeling and to carry out robust reconstruction of the 3D large scale peculiar velocity through galaxy redshift surveys, in light of RSD. (1) We propose a mathematically unique and physically motivated decomposition of peculiar velocity into three eigencomponents: an irrotational component completely correlated with the underlying density field (vdelta), an irrotational component uncorrelated with the density field (vS), and a rotational (curl) component (vB). The three components have different origins, different scale dependences, and different impacts on RSD. (2) This decomposition has the potential to simplify and improve the RSD modeling. (i) vB damps the redshift space clustering. (ii) vS causes both damping and enhancement to the redshift space power spectrum Ps(k,u). Nevertheless, the leading order contribution to the enhancement has a u4 directional dependence, distinctively different from the Kaiser formula. Here, u≡kz/k, k is the amplitude of the wave vector, and kz is the component along the line of sight. (iii) vdelta is of the greatest importance for the RSD cosmology. We find that the induced redshift clustering shows a number of important deviations from the usual Kaiser formula. Even in the limit of vS-->0 and vB-->0, the leading order contribution ∝(1+fW˜(k)u2)2. It differs from the Kaiser formula by a window function W˜(k). Nonlinear evolution generically drives W˜(k)<=1. We hence identify a significant systematical error causing underestimation of the structure growth parameter f by as much as O(10%) even at a relatively large scale k=0.1h/Mpc. (iv) The velocity decomposition reveals the three origins of the ``finger-of-God'' (FOG) effect and suggests how to simplify and improve the modeling of FOG by treating the three components separately. (v) We derive a new formula for the redshift space power spectrum. Under the velocity decomposition scheme, all high order Gaussian corrections and non-Gaussian corrections of order delta3 can be taken into account without introducing extra model uncertainties. Here delta is the nonlinear overdensity. (3) The velocity decomposition clarifies issues in peculiar velocity reconstruction through 3D galaxy distribution. We discuss two possible ways to carry out the 3D vdelta reconstruction. Both use the otherwise troublesome RSD in velocity reconstruction as a valuable source of information. Both have the advantage of rendering the reconstruction of a stochastic 3D field into the reconstruction of a deterministic window function Ws(k,u) of limited degrees of freedom. Both can automatically and significantly alleviate the galaxy bias problem and, in the limit of a deterministic galaxy bias, completely overcome it. Part 1 of this series of works lays out the methodology. Companion papers Y. Zheng  (in preparation). will extensively evaluate its performance against N-body simulations.},

@article{Bernardeau96,
	Abstract = {We introduce two new methods to obtain reliable velocity field statistics from N-body simulations, or indeed from any general density and velocity fluctuation field sampled by discrete points. These methods, the Voronoi tessellation method and Delaunay tessellation method, are based on the use of the Voronoi and Delaunay tessellations of the point distribution defined by the locations at which the velocity field is sampled. In the Voronoi method the velocity is supposed to be uniform within the Voronoi polyhedra, whereas the Delaunay method constructs a velocity field by linear interpolation between the four velocities at the locations defining each Delaunay tetrahedron.  The most important advantage of these methods is that they provide an optimal estimator for determining the statistics of volume-averaged quantities, as opposed to the available numerical methods that mainly concern mass-averaged quantities. As the major share of the related analytical work on velocity field statistics has focused on volume-averaged quantities, the availability of appropriate numerical estimators is of crucial importance for checking the validity of the analytical perturbation calculations. In addition, it allows us to study the statistics of the velocity field in the highly non-linear clustering regime.  Specifically we describe in this paper how to estimate, in both the Voronoi and the Delaunay methods, the value of the volume-averaged expansion scalar theta 0 ≡ H-1∇.upsilo (the divergence of the peculiar velocity, expressed in units of the Hubble constant H), as well as the value of the shear and the vorticity of the velocity field, at an arbitrary position. The evaluation of these quantities on a regular grid leads to an optimal estimator for determining the probability distribution function (PD F) of the volume-averaged expansion scalar, shear and vorticity. Although in most cases both the Voronoi and the Delaunay methods lead to equally good velocity field estimates, the Delaunay method may be slightly preferable. In particular it performs considerably better at small radii. Note that it is more CPU-time intensive while its requirement for memory space is almost a factor 8 lower than the Voronoi method.  As a test we here apply our estimator to that of an N-body simulation of such structure formation scenarios. The PDFs determined from the simulations agree very well with the analytical predictions. An important benefit of the present method is that, unlike previous methods, it is capable of probing accurately the velocity field statistics in regions of very low density, which in N-body simulations are typically sparsely sampled.  In a forthcoming paper we will apply the newly developed tool to a plethora of structure formation scenarios, of both Gaussian and non-Gaussian initial conditions, in order to see to what extent the velocity field PDFs are sensitive discriminators, highlighting fundamental physical differences between the scenarios.},
